            <h2>Happy New Year from the Realm of Uz!</h2>
            <span class="date">1704058980000</span>
            <p>It’s been a great year of development for the Realm of Uz team, and to cap it all off, we’re finally ready to talk about both the year’s accomplishments and release a few glimpses of content to come!</p>
            <p>Most of this year was spent building infrastructure with our custom programming language, Xyraith, which received plenty of momentous updates throughout the year as it progressed towards the long-awaited release 0.3. Work on both custom particle and shader technology, as well as slow but steady resource pack development, has continued alongside it as well, setting up the world for content to come.</p>
            <p>On the visible end of things, however, we made rather notable progress as well, starting off with the several content teasers we released throughout the year, each slightly fleshing out the vast world of the Realm of Uz. One of our personal favorites is this incredible depiction of an earth-shaking fight with a Holy Inquisitor by our talented artist and writer Artimemis!</p>
            <img src="img/inquisitor.png" width="600" alt="a warrior with a sword, fighting a floating Holy Inquisitor that is wearing golden armour, a three-pointed grey cape, and wielding a golden trident, in a cathedral.">
            <p>Our largest content release was the Backways Bar novella, a two-part prequel detailing the fall of the Greater Plane and the rise of a character essential to the Realm of Uz’s future. Along with it, we released our very own website at <a href="https://rpg.realmofuz.net/index.html">https://rpg.realmofuz.net/index.html</a>, serving as a platform for both the Backways Bar and future content to come.</p>
            <p>And finally, we made it onto the Crossroads, a Discord community for displaying Minecraft MMORPG servers. Massive thanks to Theef from the Crossroads for allowing us to gain a public presence for the very first time!</p>
            <p>And now, though we’re still not ready to announce a beta, here at last are some glimpses of content to come during the wait.</p>
            <p>The Realm of Uz’s first region will be the domain of Deterra, an expanse of swampy pampas and tropical jungles filled to the brim with places to explore and secrets to discover. The Church of Uz has rooted its power in the great city of Geopolis, once built by world-shaping magics of the Earthborn people but now claimed by its new human conquerors in the name of the Eternal King.</p>
            <p><b>Geopolis, Earthwrought City</b></p>
            <p><i>Another look at the towering cathedral at the center of Geopolis. Beneath its foundations are the remnants of another, more ancient, place of worship.</i></p>
            <img src="img/announcement/cathedral.png" width="800" alt="An image of the outside of the cathedral of Geopolis. Some debris is visible.">
            <p><i>Canals such as these link underground Earthborn reservoirs with the city’s central lake, where a floating market displays goods sourced from all across the western Realm.</i></p>
            <img src="img/announcement/canal.png" width="800" alt="An image of a canal going into a tunnel in Geopolis, Deterra.">
            <p><i>Churchmen nobles gather within the walls of this Geopolitan manor, engrossed in excessive luxury even as the threat of war looms in the north.</i></p>
            <img src="img/announcement/manor.png" width="800" alt="An image of a manor in Geopolis, Deterra.">
            <p><i>Inside the grand church, artwork depicting the Realm’s Founding is but one garnishment hailing the glory of Uz.</i></p>
            <img src="img/announcement/painting.png" width="600" alt="An image of a painting describing the founding of the Realm of Uz, located in a cathedral, wihtin Geopolis, Deterra.">
            <p>There’s still more, though! A while ago, we dropped this teaser for the item system, and now, we’re proud to show a small part of what we’ve done to translate that concept into Minecraft, complete with custom icons for every stat!</p>
            <p><b>Item UI Improvements</b></p>
            <img src="img/announcement/item_concept.png" width="400" alt="An image of an old version of a weapon of the Realm of Uz minecraft MMORPG server.">
            <p>Here’s the new, improved, and translated version, using one of the first items you may receive in your adventure.</p>
            <img src="img/announcement/wand.jpg" alt="An image of a wand of the Realm of Uz minecraft MMORPG server, in the new style and format.">
            <p>Though that’s all we can share for now, there’s still far more to come - we’re currently working on building our unique ability system, completing the Deterran overworld, and designing content such as our sprawling quest storyline, short overworld challenges, and two forms of long encounters we still can’t unveil for now. Happy New Year, and have a great 2024!</p>
