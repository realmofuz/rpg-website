					<h2>Story</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>The depth and immersion of the Realm's story is a major priority for this game. Rather than progressing by grinding for XP, "leveling" in the Realm of Uz is tied to the distinct regions of the world and their corresponding storylines, featuring complex characters that remain relevant for the entire game. While quests are a major part of the story's intersection with gameplay, worldbuilding is also shown through the environment, with care put into each build to reflect its lore.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Free the Realm from the influence of the Church of Uz</li>
						<li>Ward off parasitic gods that threaten the Realm's stability</li>
						<li>Uncover secrets and discover truths about the Realm's Founding and the Overseer behind it all</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Combat</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>Combat in the Realm of Uz rewards skill and specialization over statmaxxing, with challenging enemies and access to a wide variety of freely interchangeable gear and spells, all with unique gimmicks. While we use a traditional one-time-choice class system, you can switch between three schools at any time, each providing spell upgrades that cater to a wide range of playstyles. All of these together make each player's kit unique to their own goals and skillsets.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Upgrade any item to endgame with Enhancements, customizing them along the way</li>
						<li>Gain Mastery Points as you progress that can upgrade spells based on your chosen school</li>
						<li>Take on multiplayer combat challenges, filling party roles that defy the "Holy Trinity"</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Progress</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>The Realm of Uz is still a massive work in progress. With a small but passionate team, progress is slow but steady. Making sure we bring our plans to reality in the best way possible is more important to us than releasing as soon as possible. As a result, we do not plan to release for quite a while, but you can still check in on our progress on our Discord server and contribute to development by joining the team!</p>
