			<h3>Prologue</h3>
			<p><i>Every so often, someone goes through a door and ends up somewhere strange.</i></p>
			<p>Somewhere, there is a bar.</p>
			<p>There are a million different places where you can enter the bar - and yet, those who search for it may spend years looking all the same. You may find it at the end of a dangerous temple in a sprawling foreign jungle - behind a vault made of near-impenetrable metal on a strange planet, within a deep and dark oceanic abyss. You may find a door to it after a lifetime of searching-and upon closing it, find it leading to a different place entirely when it opens next.</p>
			<p>But just as many find it by pure chance. A cook stumbles into it after opening a dusty cupboard. A priest discovers a strange gate within their temple. The bar may seem fickle and erratic with who it chooses, but I tell you, what drives it is not simply chance. The threads of fate weave and intertwine within, past a fireplace that glows many colors at once, behind a counter serving every imaginable drink in the Plane, through the hollow souls of the clockwork bartenders that make their ways through its common room.</p>
			<p>And I sit, and I watch, unseen by all but those who I want to see me. The threads join and form tapestries before my eyes, destinies weave and conflict and combine. The game is played and the pieces moved, as the Greater Plane, this vast and chaotic world of worlds that we live in, itself shakes in response.</p>
			<p>So I welcome you now, whoever and whatever you are. I am its proprietor, and I invite you here to this beautiful, wonderful, strange and dangerous backways bar.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: The Continent</h3>
			<p>Though there are countless worlds in the Greater Plane, I shall only speak of one for now. As fate has seemingly chosen this particular planet to be quite an important one, I've noticed many of the newcomers to the bar hail from it. One continent in particular stands apart from the rest - surrounded by oceans, medium in size and populated, by among several, three central nations - all edging forwards continuously along the very brink of war with one another.</p>
			<p>It is here where we shall begin.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Neshu</h3>
			<p>A new figure arrives at the Bar.</p>
			<p>They are tall and thin, clad in many layers of silk robes and carrying themselves forwards with an elegant air. Two curling horns sprout from their pale, almost unhealthy facade, and they carry a crooked cane, limping as they walk.</p>
			<p>They're almost akin in a way to a tiefling, a race from a world rather distant from the one this newcomer hails from. In fact, an actual tiefling, a weathered planeshifter in utilitarian vestments, takes a suspicious glance at them as they settle onto a barstool with a mix of practiced grace and staggered force - recognizing soon that they aren't one of their kind despite their appearance.</p>
			<p>The figure does not respond, though, and with their legs finally supported, the grace of their steps wins out, and they vaguely sign to the bartender a large and extravagant cocktail. The automaton understands the order and begins to prepare it deftly as they settle down in preparation.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: Neshu, pas Aventaria</h3>
			<p>A Lunar Priest, a worshiper of the god of the moon and death Daekkan within the Vylmaran capital, the one that styles themself Neshu is observantly not truly a tiefling, despite using magical cosmetic touches to better resemble one. Neshu's marks, discoloration, and ill health are all products of the various deals that the human, or so I am sure of, has made with various godlike beings, demons, and spirits over the years in exchange for power, knowledge, and most importantly, life.</p>
			<p>Though during the day they are a normal, if not slightly unorthodox, Lunar Priest, Neshu moonlights as a member of the House of the Fourfold Path, a secret society of alchemists and occultists attempting to find the secrets to immortality.</p>
			<p>In fact, they are one of the more advanced human members of the House, being 348 years of age as of the most recent spring. Still, this is thanks to a house of cards in magical terms, and this extended lifespan is in a constant state of near-failure and just-in-time fixes. The on-demand Blue-Gold Elixir from my bar has greatly aided with their condition, but I believe Neshu seems to yearn for a more permanent solution - as does seemingly every member of their order.</p>
			<p>The House of the Fourfold Path - both as a part of its nature and due to organizational entanglements - has an outstanding grudge with the Cult of the Cleansing Worm and unfortunately for them, the Ascendant Sovereign, as well as deep ties to the various partisan and resistance movements embedded inside the Empire of Vylmar.</p>
			<p>Helping out these resistance cells and sheltering political refugees is one of Neshu's main responsibilities in the House, and nearly three decades of witnessing the damage the Empire does firsthand has deeply embittered Neshu towards Vylmar.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Aurelion</h3>
			<p>A man walks into the bar.</p>
			<p>The man is human; tall and lean, with a pale countenance and silvery-black hair. He wears a stiff military uniform with a patch displaying the sigil of a coiling red dragon. A gold medal below it identifies the man as a Centurion of Vylmar - a commander of middling rank.</p>
			<p>A group of burly Jossinarians scowl at him as he passes by. One spits on the floor besides him, but the man pays her no mind. He walks to the countertop, his expression impassive, and sets the elegant steel saber he's been carrying atop it.</p>
			<p>Of all the posts in the Empire, the man thinks as he studies the strange room, of course Augusta had to send him here, to this strange... place. It was so distant from the Vylmaran mainland, frequented with hostile barbarians and strange creatures, the likes of which even Vylmar's archivists had not recorded before.</p>
			<p>Daekkan's Hells, he didn't even know exactly where he was. The outskirts of the Empire? A distant land? A distant world?</p>
			<p>The tavern, if it was truly one, seemed detached from everything else, adrift in a limbo of its own. Why had the Legate herself deemed this place so important to Imperial plans?</p>
			<p>It didn't matter in the end. The orders were orders, and he had to follow them, whatever it took. How else could he rise in Imperial ranks?</p>
			<p>The man sighs and signals to the bartender, trying not to seem fazed by the strange being's countenance.</p>
			<p>"Regalios bless you today, innkeeper," he says politely. "A medium beer, if you may."</p>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: The Vylmaran Empire</h3>
			<p>Of the three, Vylmar is certaintly the mightiest. The oldest and largest-spanning, the Empire reaches from the northern shore of Blackblood Bay to the southern river lands that make up the domain of House Vaexattor.</p>
			<p>Although Vylmar is technically ruled by its Empress, Alexandra III, it ironically has one of the weakest political systems internally. The Empress' claim is uncertain after the last great rebellion against her House, and the other Great Houses squabble and scheme ever-constantly, dividing up the mighty imperium for their own gains. Perhaps that is why the other two have been able to withstand it.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Low</h3>
			<p>An elf walks, a little off-balance, into the bar and takes a look around, squinting at the automatons. If they're surprised, they don't show it. They wear dark green leather armor, but it's so worn that you can see a second layer of brown leather underneath. The various sticks in their hair don't seem intentional until a squirrel peeks out from it, but even then, the squirrel might not be intentional either. They have pallid skin and what little hue is in their eyes is green.</p>
			<p>"Ale," they tell the bartender, putting three unfamiliar copper coins on the table, "substandard."</p>
			<p>The bartender pauses for a moment, before going to pour a mug and ignoring the coins. The elf shrugs, and puts the coins back in their pocket before settling down and taking the drink.</p>
			<span class="annotation">
			<p>In truth, I was quite surprised when they asked me for my perspective. It's not every day, after all, that an old enemy shows up from seemingly nowhere to make a deal with you.</p>
			<p>Though, I have to admit now, our enmity did fade after my employer and I broke ties.</p>
			<p>Ah, and even furthermore when they died.</p>
			</span>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: Those of the Shadows</h3>
			<p>Beneath the exterior of this continent lies a fascinating and dangerous web of underground organizations. To understand the extent of what we see, we must look deep within in turn.</p>
			<p>It would not do justice to the narrative without mention of the Black Guilds. Old and powerful, they have roots in nearly every single nation on the planet - perhaps with more beyond. The Guilds number twelve in total, each specializing in their own unique dark art. I personally believe it to be rather dramatic - but knowing their founder, I can't truly say it's too surprising.</p>
			<p>But the Black Guilds are not the only force at work - quite far from it. I'd imagine you know of Neshu's House of the Fourfold Path - and the various other similar occult organizations at work in the midst of it all, all caught in a tense sort of arcane rivalry. Dozens of smaller clans and gangs have risen in the underground as well, with the most commonly known faction other than the Guilds being the Zarian, which intends to fell the Black Guilds. Its attempts so far have been unsurprisingly rendered utterly futile.</p>
			<p>Alas, I must say that the Cult of the Ascendant Sovereign exerts its influence in this space too, as it has done nearly everywhere else - but that is a matter we will not discuss now. I'd imagine it will come into question quite soon anyways.</p>
			<h3>Thedra</h3>
			<p>Nobody saw the door open, and no one heard it close. The bartender, engrossed in the preparation of a drink, didn't notice the mug of ale go missing, but when it turned around, it did notice the two silver on the countertop, glistening like fragments of light from the very moon they were designed after.</p>
			<p>A certain elf, sitting alone at a table, reaches to take a sip from their mug, but before they can touch the drink, a metal claw with veins of purple energy running through it shoots out from seemingly nowhere, attached to a rope-like substance made of both plant and metal, snatches the ale, and returns to its owner, who happens to be sitting at an adjacent table, twenty feet away.</p>
			<p>As the plant-metal arm snakes its way back to this figure, the plain, simple robe - one so simple, in fact, that it looks as though this person had just draped a blanket over themselves, is cast aside in a dramatic motion.</p>
			<p>Underneath this "robe" lies a strange and - as I'm sure she would have said - stunning figure. Although she appears to be human, standing at around five and a half feet tall, so many alterations have by now been made to her warped body that "human" is most likely quite far from the truth.</p>
			<p>Though she has two normal human arms, instead of blood flowing through their veins, a strange glowing purple substance runs instead. Two other arms made of the vine-covered metal extend behind her, tipped with jagged claws.</p>
			<p>But the most striking part of her appearance is of course, her mask. Although seemingly made of normal steel, it melds to her facade like a second face, its silvery lips moving alongside her own and its iron eyes blinking naturally with her facial motions.</p>
			<p>Though the mask is clearly not natural in itself - what it hides - or rather does not; merely gives its purpose away further. Behind the mask, or perhaps within it, flows power - a pulsating, seemingly limitless strength that I now must admit has become simply too familiar by now.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: The Lich</h3>
			<p>Few from my time still live now, and those who deserve it are rare among them. Irivex is the worst of them all - and I must admit now, one of the primary reasons why I came here in the first place.</p>
			<p>To begin, it would be an understatement to call Irivex old. No-he is <i>ancient</i>, a being who came to the world when its population was barely a third of the size it is now. Here, on this backwater planet, he used the power he held to forge himself a truly mythical reputation; to some, becoming, quite ironically, the image of death itself.</p>
			<p>But in truth, Irivex is far from any god - especially one of such a thing as mortality. No; the true deities that I have known do not fear their own domains. </p>
			<br>
			<h3>Neshu</h3>
			<p>Neshu pays little noticeable mind to the first of the newcomers, though inside their mind is a whirling vortex. A Centurion. Here? Was there no place free from the dragon's gaze?</p>
			<p>Their thoughts are doused, however, as the priest, with a machine-like smoothness, moves their placid gaze towards the third newcomer.</p>
			<p>"Obscure Proverb: Accost not the Aunoctian within a bar, especially if a priest awaits in the wings. I doubt she is an Aunoctian, but I feel the message holds."</p>
			<p>And that sent the priest into a proper coughing fit.</p>
			<p>Thankfully, the clockwork bartender finally sets the extravagant cocktail in front of the priest, squeezing a few drops from a black bottle into the concoction. The drink, initially a dark and muddled red, transforms all at once into a bright, nigh-neon blue.</p>
			<p>The priest's voice sounds far more steady after they've taken down their first sip of the drink. Their gaze turns to the elf.</p>
			<p>"You have not introduced yourself. From whereforth have you come?"</p>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: The Approach of War</h3>
			<p>It is said that wherever power resides, unrest will follow. It is not only the Vylmaran imperium that lays claim to the continent-the kingdom of Hernan, led by its God-King Thailaik, and the city-states of the Jossic Federation, all seek to expand their own domains. With the decline of Vylmar, its rivals begin to encroach upon its control in turn - and the seeds of war are sown.</p>
			<p>It is this path, divided and squabbling amongst each other, that allows <i>others</i> to now take advantage of this state of disrepair and lay their own, even more ambitious, claims upon the world.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Aurelion</h3>
			<p>While waiting for his drink, the man scans the bar, noting its inhabitants. <i>What a strange place</i>, he thinks, his eyes passing over a plant-like humanoid being in one corner.</p>
			<p>He remembers Augusta's words.</p>
			<p><i>Keep watch. The information that you will collect here is of the utmost importance. Study the barbarians - drink with them, dice with them. But remember your cause - stay vigilant. You will know when to leave.</i></p>
			<p>The man suddenly freezes at the sight of a robed tiefling near the back of the room, sitting besides an elf in a heavy cloak. Somehow, he recognizes them - although he doesn't know exactly how.</p>
			<p>Reattaching his sword to his belt, he makes his way across the room, causing the strange mechanical bartender to turn towards him nervously. He stops by the tiefling's table and smiles forcefully.</p>
			<p>"Do I know you?" he asks. "I believe I've seen you in the capital. A priest of Daekkan, I assume?"</p>
			<p>The priest takes another sip of their drink. When they speak again, their voice has regained yet more clarity.</p>
			<p>"Centurion. You would assume correctly. I've not seen you, however. I am Neshu, pas Aventaria. You?"</p>
			<p>The man nods. "I am Centurion Aurelion of the House Darax," he introduces himself. "It's    always a welcome surprise to meet another resident of the Empire, isn't it? Vylmarans should stick together more than ever, especially with Jossinar and Hernan preparing for war."</p>
			<p>He instinctively runs his fingers along the edge of his saber. "I've heard some truly worrying things lately. The dead stirring from their graves near the Skjaldan islands? A new God-King in Hernan?"</p>
			<p>He stops, letting the silence sink in.</p>
			<p>"And yet, what worries me most is this talk of internal rebellion. Worshippers of barbarian gods stirring up insurrections and strife? What a terrible thing to do, wouldn't you agree? Heresy of the highest degree against the Empress and the Triumvirate itself."</p>
			<p>Although he doesn't show it, Aurelion's mind is abuzz with thoughts.</p>
			<p>Why was another Vylmaran here, in distant and foreign territory so far from the mainland. Conversing with barbarians, no less? Who were they truly - were they even who they claimed to be, or had his own memories failed him?</p>
			<p>They were troubling thoughts, and Aurelion decided that he needed to tread carefully. The right words could make a strong difference between a newfound ally and a dangerous enemy.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: The Gods of Vylmar</h3>
			<p>Once, when Vylmar was merely a small union of city-states bound by a common senate, Vylmarans worshipped a diverse pantheon of gods, deities of nature and the elements. Things have changed much since then, and after the nation's first Emperor rose to power, many of the old gods were eradicated and erased from memory. Now, most Vylmarans only worship the Godly Triumvirate; the three gods Regalios, Vaellenia, and Daekkan.</p>
			<p>Regalios is the leader of the Triumvirate, the god of day, life, and creation. He's heavily associated with the sun, as Vylmarans claim that the star contains Regalios' Five Heavens, a heavenly paradise for those with the most merit.</p>
			<p>Vaellenia is Regalios' sister and the god of dusk, dawn, and time. The stars are her realm, where spirits are judged before they go to her brothers' afterlives.</p>
			<p>Daekkan, Regalios' brother, reigns over death and the night. Daekkan's domain is the moon, which contains his Five Hells, the cold and barren afterlife reserved for the worst of sinners and heretics.</p>
			<p>Although the Triumvirate is the only "accepted" religion in most of Vylmar, worship of the old gods of the stars, moon, and sun is still technically legal. Although it's a practice frowned upon by the Vylmaran government, such deities are similar enough to the Triumvirate that they are effectively the same gods.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Low</h3>
			<p>The elf stares as the arm that took the mug lifts it up to her lips. The being tilts her head back and takes a long sip, after which she tosses the mug back in the elf's direction.</p>
			<p>"Can't you afford anything better than this?" she asks, in a soft, high-pitched voice, with a mild southern accent.</p>
			<p>You don't like it, get something yourself," replies the elf, face impassive. "and the best tastes the worst."</p>
			<p>In an obvious effort to maintain conversation, the human pushes herself away from the table she's sitting at with her strange plant-arms, such that the elf is now facing her.</p>
			<p>"Your taste in ale could do better, then. Maybe I'm just spoiled - I've seen hundreds of these before - and I'd say I'm quite comfortable in all of them. As long as I get to talk to people and drink ale. If it's good ale, not the stuff you were drinking." She gestures at the ale, now spilled on the floor.</p>
			<p>"Talking to people and drinking ale might be my two favorite things to do. What do you like doing? I mean, what do you do for a living? Gosh, I confuse the two so much, because I love what I do for a living, so I assume everyone else does too."</p>
			<p>This human is speaking incredibly quickly, such that her words are barely comprehensible. While she's speaking, her numerous arms are doing various things - she is, for instance, with one of them, petting the squirrel in the elf's hair.</p>
			<p>But even despite the almost imperceptible blur of movement that surrounds her, as the elf quickly notices, her eyes are intensely focused on him.</p>
			<p>The elf growls hostilely - and for more reasons than one.</p>
			<p>"Don't. Disturb. The squirrel." The squirrel seems undisturbed, and the elf looks at an unoccupied stretch of wall. "Seriously? You're going to let them touch you?"</p>
			<p>They turn around to see a mug of ale replaced on the counter. They take a short but large drink of it, before turning back to the pseudo-human.</p>
			<p>"And I'd really rather not converse with anyone, actually. Go ahead, take the squirrel, then at least it won't have the chance to ditch me on purpose."</p>
			<p>The last line is almost pointed in a strange way. Whatever the elf meant, however, seems to be lost to the other being.</p>
			<p>"Ooh, I get the squirrel?" she asks, tone apparently oblivious to the remark - whatever it truly was.  "I love being near alive things, thanks!"</p>
			<p>The pseudo-human reaches out an artificial arm to the squirrel, upon which the squirrel climbs rapidly, before climbing to rest on her shoulder.</p>
			<p>"Well, I'm tired, and I have a new friend that I gotta get to know better... Thedra out!"</p>
			<p>The human, who has made herself known as Thedra, slinks into the shadows, slowly stroking her squirrel with one of her artificial arms. The metal face of her mask contorts into a smile that doesn't seem like it should fit on the face as she recedes away, revealing rows of pointed teeth.</p>
			<p>It's clear that there's most definitely something very wrong about her.</p>
			<p>The elf definitely recognizes this as well, and takes the opportunity of the centurion's questions as a distraction for the tiefling, slipping away quietly and casually. The tiefling doesn't notice; the centurion sees the elf stand and walk off, but only Thedra, watching the encounter, sees the elf sit down a few tables away before pulling out a deck of cards.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Neshu</h3>
			<p>Neshu watches the proceedings with a wary interest.</p>
			<p>The elf pauses first, nearby. They've shuffled twice, and they were about to do so a third time - until this. They put away the deck of cards, and walk over quietly.</p>
			<p>"The graves of the Isles have opened again? I'd begun to hope, after two hundred years, that they might stay shut forever. But of course, Irivex is too ambitious for that, and I've no doubt Devarien is still right alongside him, defiling the peace of the dead, the traitor."</p>
			<p>The priest themself is outwardly placid, but their mind is abuzz as well.</p>
			<p>Humanity was never meant to hold the sheer breadth of memories Neshu must, and the priest has packed most of them away in constructs and implanted gemstones. After a moment of mental searching, Neshu finds what they were looking for, the context to that twinge of familiarity.</p>
			<p>The unlocked memory recounts to Neshu a confrontation with an imperial force some decade ago. The deep cowl couldn't hide all of their features, but Neshu had tried to ensure that none of the bloody dragons made it out of the manor alive anyway. Clearly, they had failed.</p>
			<p>Still, the Centurion doesn't look as if they recognize Neshu. Right?</p>
			<p>Neshu knows not the bar's rhyme or reason for allowing invitees, and for now has basically given up on trying to find it. Still, they've known many a mole or turncoat within the legions. Perhaps this Aurelion could be swayed as well.</p>
			<p>Whatever the case is, a new matter catches Neshu's ear as the elf speaks, drawing far nearer to them than before. The first thing that Neshu thinks when they notice the elf walk over is that reality has begun to fray again. There's little evidence to support this, but there are very few creatures stealthy enough to evade the priest's notice, and Neshu has never heard of this elf before.</p>
			<p>The priest takes another sip of the elixir. Their voice is nearly completely hale, now, the chime tone speaking in an accent familiar to none.</p>
			<p>"Irivex stirs? Speak ye truly, elf, Irivex stirs? Centurion, I know you speak true: my flock is waning, as of late. Dark thoughts lie, waiting, in the hearts of passersby. But would I name heretics the merely misguided? They are but mortal, as us all. Young. Passionate."</p>
			<p>Another sip. The priest shivers slightly. Something dark enters their eyes.</p>
			<p>"A Lich is something else entirely. A creature so desperate to escape death that it threw its life away to continue a tortured existence. A fragility, born from and surviving on unfathomable suffering. Beyond heresy - an abomination."</p>
			<p>Neshu makes for their drink again - but it is finished. Their gaze, for just a moment, lingers on the empty cup. They move to speak, then pause, then move to speak again.</p>
			<p>"Still, dissidents are no laughing matter. There are no gods but the Three, no just rule but the Empress. Heresy is still a terrible thing. Which might then bring us to the subject of the 'God'-King."</p>
			<p>Neshu sees Aurelion initially smile in agreement, but the expression quickly fades. Instead, a strange look appears on his face in replacement, one that the priest can't exactly discern. "These are dark things we speak of," he finally says. "Shall I buy you both drinks to lighten the mood?"</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Aurelion</h3>
			<p>Aurelion initially smiles in agreement with the strange priest's words, but the expression quickly fades.</p>
			<p>Heresy.</p>
			<p>Even now, the memories are still vivid in his mind - almost as if the priest's words refreshed them.</p>
			<p>The smell came first. The stench of burning flesh, of waves of deadly arcane magic ripping through men like a blade through soft butter. He remembered as soldiers stormed the manor's gates, only to be repulsed by exploding fireballs and bolts of arcing lightning.</p>
			<p>An entire legion had tried to take the manor that day, defended by only fifteen of the House's sorcerers. Of them, two had survived - and while Aurelion had remained a Centurion, Augusta had been promoted to the rank of Legate, assigned to a post in the capital.</p>
			<p>And now, here he was. In a place that didn't truly exist, trying to find answers to a question he didn't understand in the first place.</p>
			<p>"These are dark things we speak of," he says. "Shall I buy you both drinks to lighten the mood?"</p>
			<p>The elf abruptly intercuts him before Neshu can respond.</p>
			<p>So you want information," the elf responds. "You're not here because you want to be, or to meet people - you're just here to find out what you can. Don't pretend you didn't give yourself away with the offer."</p>
			<p>Aurelion tenses, gripping the hilt of his sword almost instinctively. He almost draws it before getting ahold of his senses, inhaling sharply.</p>
			<p>"Aren't we all, in some way or another?" he replies, chuckling as if it was a jape. Despite his words, he doesn't let go of the saber.</p>
			<p>He steps towards the elf and whispers, his voice so low that only the elf can hear it. "Bold, aren't you? An admirable trait. Marcus Paenaron was also bold, before his rebellion was crushed in three days by Emperor Correl the Second. Sadly, his boldness did not prevent the deaths of six thousand men."</p>
			<p>Before the elf can respond, Aurelion takes a mug of beer from the bartender and hands it to him, turning around and leaving for a table in the center of the room.</p>
			<p>The elf writes a note before walking over to the table to say, "I'd be perfectly willing to exchange information."</p>
			<p>The elf quaffs the entire mug, dropping the piece of paper. It's written in common script, though a bit messy.</p>
			<p class="loh">Marcus' men slew five foes each with half the equipment, but that's irrelevant.</p>
			<p class="loh">I'd simply prefer if you were bold enough not to hide your intentions.</p>
			<p>In a whirl of motion that seems too fast to be real, Thedra is standing at Aurelion's side, that sharp, huge grin still permeating her face.</p>
			<p>Her soft, high-pitched voice is entirely replaced by a deep rasp.</p>
			<p>"Now, what might give you the authority to make such claims? In some circles, you would be struck down in a second for words like that, your limbs scattered amongst the trees in the forest, and your organs fed to the wolves. You should know that Marcus Paenaron was burned at the stake."</p>
			<p>Returning to her deep rasp, "You. I don't believe I know you, and yet I feel that I should. After all, it seems that our goals are aligned."</p>
			<p>She then turns away and slinks back into the shadows. Neshu notices, as she walks away, that one of her metal claws is stained with some red substance.</p>
			<p>The squirrel is nowhere in sight.</p>
			<p>The elf's face grows dark. "I fought Irivex with my own two hands and knives", they say, at a low volume but harsh tone, to nobody in particular, "and if you'd seen him, heard his voice, even just smelled his rank stench, you'd agree with each word I spoke."</p>
			<p>The elf makes a gesture, a sort of cutting motion with their second finger tucked under their thumb. Nobody else knows what it means.</p>
			<p>They walk off to sit back down, and pull their deck of cards back out.</p>

			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: The House of Darax</h3>
			<p>Aurelion traces his lineage back to Leto Darax, a wealthy lord and leader of a Great House of Vylmar during the golden age of the Empire. Leto made the fateful mistake of siding with the rebel lords Marcus and later Darius Paeneron, who attempted to revolt against the Emperor in an attempt to bring back the senate of old. When the rebellion was eventually quenched by the Emperor, House Darax was stripped of their lands and vassals, soon becoming an insignificant player in the Empire's politics. Although Leto's descendants have worked long and hard to gain their place back, even now, many still associate Darax as a house of traitors.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Neshu</h3>
			<p>Neshu was silent for a very long time. Then, for the first since they had arrived, the priest rose from their stool. With each step accompanied by the rapping of their cane upon the ground, they approached the elf before melting into the seat opposite them.</p>
			<p>"A game of Leivas, perhaps?"</p>
			<p class="loh">Old Vylmaran Cant: A standard opening phrase, to indicate awareness of the cant.</p>
			<p>The elf shuffles three more times, unusually quickly.</p>
			<p>"I'd be willing, if the blue jay calls at seven and the fifth card's lost."</p>
			<p class="loh">Then-Modern Jossinarian Cant: A standard return phrase to accept the offered game; we should not continue if you are a member of the Zarian; I'm familiar with your opening, except for the fifth word.</p>
			<p>"Only my brothers and I, unfortunately. I only ever learned to play with the fifth, will that be an issue?"</p>
			<p class="loh">This is the only opener I know. Are you from an organization linked with mine?</p>
			<p>The elf seems to frown a bit.</p>
			<p>"Your deck's old, but no matter, and the fifth's a traveler, but I suppose I can play without. The crow sang at four, but my song's sleeping. I'm fine to play, but the guest deals, of course."</p>
			<p class="loh">Your codes are outdated, but I still understand them; your opening is still strange to me, but it doesn't matter; I'm a member of the Order of the Blade, but I haven't had contact with it for a long time. We can continue.</p>
			<p>The elf smirks again, though it's very unclear why.</p>
			<p>"Of course."</p>
			<p>Neshu takes the deck and deals straight - one card to themself, then one card to the elf, back and forth until each have a starting hand of six. Neshu is aware that dealing patterns aren't much of a thing anymore, and this is a message on the level of the game: Though Neshu is allowed to deal the cards from anywhere inside the deck, and in any order that they please, to deal straight is a sign of extreme confidence, whether real or bluffed. The priest here says either "I trust you" or "I do not need to trust you," it depends on context. Perhaps it is both.</p>
			<p>"I've always been partial to this game, though I don't get to play it often. The sleeping song sends shivers down my spine."</p>
			<p class="loh">My organization is on the periphery of the underground, which doesn't deal directly with seedier enterprises, and you likely haven't heard of it. I've not heard of your organization.</p>
			<span class="annotation">
				Typically, that first phrase would just be translated as "I'm part of a clean crew", but transcribing it as such is likely better for a typical populace. Plus, it's about 270 years out of date, so it doesn't really matter.
			</span>
			<p>"The crow sings far, but I've not heard further. What pitch shall this note be?"</p>
			<p class="loh">My organization is large enough that if you don't know it, I probably don't know yours. What topic shall we discuss?</p>
			<p>Before Neshu can respond, the door abruptly opens, sending a blast of cold air into the room. Low turns, intrigued, and Neshu follows in suit.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Xownfos</h3>
			<p>The door creaks slowly as a robed figure emerges.</p>
			<p>A kitsune woman with a singular white tail, long flowing white hair, and two tailed robe stands in the doorway as another gust of cold wind blows into the bar, bringing a flurry of snowflakes with it.</p>
			<p>Her eyes are covered by a veil that stands inside of the hood of her cloak. She stands a bit under six feet tall with a lithe build. The only feature that catches your eyes is the veil with a glyph stitched in gold onto the center.</p>
			<p>"This-," she pauses, "is not where I expected to turn up."</p>
			<p>Her hand moves to her waist as if ready to draw something from underneath her robe.</p>
			<p>"I knew the door was enchanted, but not with this powerful of a magic. Identify yourselves, I demand it..."</p>
			<p>Movement, impossibly fast movement, at the edge of the kitsune's vision, and she feels a cold, metal claw on her shoulder.</p>
			<p>"I wouldn't try that," says the soft, light voice, "The force inside this bar, whatever it is, doesn't much like it when you try to attack people. I, however, am kind enough to introduce myself: I am Thedra."</p>
			<p>Another surge of movement, and the being calling herself Thedra is at the table where Low sits. The kitsune follows, intrigued.</p>
			<p>"I love watching people play," Thedra comments. " - so many different styles. They can really tell you a lot about a person." She smirks at those last words.</p>
			<p>The elf smirks in turn.</p>
			<p>"I see the Knave's opening used more and more frequently."</p>
			<p>Then, the elf, looking the pseudo-human dead in the mask's eyes, asks, "What song do you sing, then?"</p>
			<p class="loh">What organization are you a part of?</p>
			<p>The kitsune's head tilts slightly at the notion of the power only retaliating against attacks, but her hand stays at her waist as she steps towards the table of cards.</p>
			<p>"Well met, Thedra. I am Xownfos of the Siannodel Guild. If you wouldn't mind, please remove the law off my person. Still, if you aren't trying to instigate anything why bother with the enchantment on the door? I've been through that door many times before, and it doesn't normally lead to this-" she pauses again trying to come up with a name for the room, "-this pub."</p>
			<p>From nearby, Neshu turns towards her, expression curious. "She owns not the bar, Madam Xownfos-of-Siannodel. None here understand its enchantments, but, er, good job on the invitation? The machine," they say, pointing towards the giant clockwork apparatus behind the bar, "serves any drink. Would you care to join the Leivas table?"</p>
			<p>Xownfos nods. "I'd be glad to. But I must test this clock you tell of."</p>
			<p>With an outstretched hand, she waves to the machine. "An Icevein Concoction, if you mind." At the counter, one of the mechanisms nods in response and begins preparing.</p>
			<p>While she waits for the clock to respond, she turns back to Neshu. "By the way, I didn't catch your name. What should I address you as?"</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Neshu</h3>
			<p>Despite what their appearance may have led you to believe, in truth, Neshu is no mage, at least not a traditional one. Their manasight can barely sense an active spell, let alone potentia. Their anima detection is better, all but the smallest meridians are galaxies in an otherwise black void, but by far the most developed world-sense of Neshu, pas Aventaria is their grafted attunement to the elements - or rather, the twelve that mask their identities as them.</p>
			<p>Neshu generally relies on attunement, but those other senses are not useless. Far from it. Thedra cannot hide a flare of magic, and Low cannot hide a flare in the soul. Also, the alcohol. Quite a tip-off, yes?</p>
			<p>For safety's sake, at least, the creature that calls itself Neshu sets a short mental timer and dumps all possible incriminating memories into the contingency crystal embedded deep inside their sternum. The priest is now one in truth, thirty-four years old and merely assisting the Capitoline Underground on occasion out of moral concerns.</p>
			<p>This rewrite isn't very thorough and will fall apart under basic scrutiny, but Neshu isn't the type to scrutinize themself, and it's not as if any invaders will be able to find the buried memories - they simply aren't there.</p>
			<p>Neshu takes a moment to mull something over in their head. "Bah", they think, "it's a bar setting. It matters not." Of course, the currently massive gaps in their memory and understanding of the world allow Neshu to miss the fact that the conventions they worry over are centuries out of date.</p>
			<p>"I am Neshu, pas Aventaria, Priest of Nightbrother Daekkan within the Imperial Seat. 'Tis nice to meet thee."</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Aurelion</h3>
			<p>Aurelion barely notices the newcomer as he settles into the darkness of the room's far corner. Partially covering himself with his cloak, Aurelion reaches into a hidden compartment within the robes and pulls out a small, circular metal device with a gemstone embedded into its surface. Aurelion puts a hand on the gem's surface, and after a while, the device glows brightly and begins to beep, emanating a pale violet light.</p>
			<p>After a few seconds, the light coalesces into the figure of a tall woman in steel armor. Her face is scarred and she wears her hair in a small braid, her eyes a cold shade of deep gray.</p>
			<p>She turns to Aurelion, her expression almost surprised. "Centurion Aurelion. Have there been any issues with contacting me?"</p>
			<p>"There have not, Legate," Aurelion responds.</p>
			<p>"Good," Augusta replies calmly. "I spoke with Consul Vaexattor earlier this morning. He demands progress and information. What have you found?"</p>
			<p>"Not much yet, Legate," Aurelion begins. "But I believe I have found a clue to what we seek. Here, allow me. It is better if you see for yourself."</p>
			<p>Still trying to conceal himself, he holds the device upwards, shining the light in the direction of Neshu and Low.</p>
			<p>"Have you seen this 'Neshu' before? I have a suspicion that they know far more than they should."</p>
			<p>From the device, Augusta's breath suddenly hisses through her teeth. She almost flinches and her eyes grow wide.</p>
			<p>"You suspect correctly, Centurion. They were there at the manor," the Legate says, breathing heavily. "I know it - I remember them. They tried to summon the construct on us."</p>
			<p>Aurelion exhales deeply. Could it be?</p>
			<p>"Are you sure?" he asks nervously. "Why would a member of the House be here?"</p>
			<p>"Whatever it is, they are exceedingly dangerous - as I am sure Consul Vaexattor recognizes as well. You must not let them leave the bar's premises. We have been searching too long to let this opportunity escape us."</p>
			<p>"What should I do?" Aurelion asks, glancing towards the table where Neshu sits.</p>
			<p>"Whatever you must," Augusta instructs. "Stall for time, preferably. And if all goes wrong, kill them."</p>
			<p>Aurelion nods, studying the tiefling worriedly. "With all respect, are you sure this is a wise course of action? They seem... quite dangerous."</p>
			<p>"Then simply buy us time," Augusta decides. "I will send you reinforcements if necessary."</p>
			<p>"I'm not sure if any ordinary soldiers could suffice here," Aurelion muses. "There are several other beings in the bar, each seemingly very powerful."</p>
			<p>Augusta's figure stops, resting a hand on her chin.</p>
			<p>"Will a Praetorian serve?" she eventually asks. Her eyes flicker over the bar, calculating.</p>
			<p>Aurelion feels a chill run up his spine. "Yes... I believe one will take care of the situation quite well. Just... do not let it become too messy."</p>
			<p>Augusta smiles grimly. "I believe your request isn't much of an option when it comes to the Praetorian."</p>
			<p>Aurelion shivers. <i>A Praetorian? Here?</i> It seemed that Augusta was ready to take any measure possible, no matter how decisive they could be.</p>
			<p>"My actions are giving away too much right now," he says. "I will speak to you later."</p>
			<p>"Very well," the Legate responds, her tone still uncertain. "Contact me if anything else happens."</p>
			<p>The image flickers away and disappears, leaving Aurelion alone with the device. But before the Centurion can put it away, Neshu suddenly seems to notice him. Their eyes widen in realization.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: Ranks of the Empire</h3>
			<p>As befits most large civilizations, the Vylmaran Empire's, despite what it may seem, structure is one of the most disjointed on its very continent.</p>
			<p>Though the Empress Alexandra rules in name, it is her council that holds the key to her power. Her consuls, from the most powerful few Great Houses - Vaexattor, Rennain, Alharon, and Carador, each hold almost as much power as her own. These Houses each govern their own sector of the Empire and its capital, cities that often rival the Imperial Seat itself in wealth and influence.</p>
			<p>The Imperial army shares this same structure, being rather than controlled directly by the Empress, made up of various legions each contributed by a Great House. Thus, the Imperial Consuls have taken to each amassing as many as possible in preparation for the coming storm. Unsurprisingly, Vaexattor is in the lead.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Low</h3>
			<p>Thedra stares into their eyes. Five seconds pass. Ten.</p>
			<p>Thedra's eyes widen. She staggers back.</p>
			<p>"Y-You."</p>
			<p>She raises a trembling human arm, bringing it up to point it at the elf.</p>
			<p>"You shouldn't be here."</p>
			<p>In the elf's sight, which begins to blur and warp before him, the lights of the bar start flickering, and Thedra's metal mask melts away to reveal a horrific visage, with her mouth locked in a face-wide grin and the eyes seemingly gouged out, dripping with some black liquid. The claws, both of which now seem to be bloodstained, start extending toward the elf.</p>
			<p>"I don't know how, by the gods above and below, you got out of Irivex's hands but you sure as hell won't-"</p>
			<p>Thedra is cut off as the shadows stir and a <b>force</b> moves from the beyond to block her. All goes black-</p>
			<p>-and the scene cuts back to normal.</p>
			<p>The force is gone, the lights are no longer flickering, and Thedra's mask is back, a single drop of black liquid dropping to the floor from its surface.</p>
			<p>"My apologies," she says to the elf, back in her normal voice, "I got a bit carried away there. I was just... surprised that your previous statement held truth. Not many fight Irivex and live to tell the tale."</p>
			<p>"My tune is with the One Below, of course - who else?"</p>
			<span class="annotation">
				This is the most broken cant I've ever heard in my life. I still don't even fully know now what she was trying to say.
			</span>
			<p>In response, the elf puts their cards face down on the table and stands.</p>
			<p>"I am called Low. I'm not surprised that Devarien decided to cut me out of the story. I don't intend to describe my survival, lest it prevent another's."</p>
			<p>It was clear that she had searched his brain. Lohlethean had learned self-deception a long time ago, but it took effort. He was on guard now - he didn't know how much she had learned, but he could make some assumptions. Not yet, however. Not yet.</p>
			<p>They'll kill you.</p>
			<p>He'd known for a long time that he was probably insane. He was good at hiding it, and it was generally manageable.</p>
			<p>You'll have to kill them first.</p>
			<p>No, they can be useful yet.</p>
			<p>No, they're too danger-</p>
			<p>Even the maniacal voices in his head argued with each other. It had started back then, he thought. Back when the traitor revealed her nature.</p>
			<p>Kill it! It knows too-</p>
			<p>Shut up.</p>
			<p>That usually didn't work, but it never hurt to try. It had been a long time since those voices had cooperated, and even longer since they'd said anything helpful.</p>
			<p>But the tiefling... they were interesting. Their cant had been several hundred years old, and they'd dealt straight. Lohlethean began to recall the... not now. Not with the halflife. At least he'd... not that.</p>
			<p>His thoughts were scattering. Bad. Penguins. Could the halflife have forged a link? He searched his mind.</p>
			<p>Screams. More screams. Deeper. Screams, screams, screams, further down, screams, screams. Screams, screams... blackness.</p>
			<p>And beyond that, where even he no longer did not dare go...</p>
			<p>He could always go there, when the voices had gotten too loud at night. They were always worse at night. Not now. No, there was just a crack left, from the puncture. He could seal that up. And now he knew what to watch for.</p>
			<p>Done.</p>
			<p>At least he didn't have to endure the screams on the way up, even if everyone had just watched him stare blankly into nothingness for... however long.</p>
			<p>Lohlothean turned to the bartender. "A shot of the strongest you've got." Alcohol pushed the voices away.</p>
			<p>A glass on the counter. He downed it all at once, and it burned in his throat.</p>
			<p>He'd always wondered why psychologically influencing poison stopped the voices. It made more sense for it to make them worse, but he didn't really need a reason. Nothing made much sense anymore.</p>
			<p>He turned back to the halflife and the tiefling.</p>
			<p>"Sorry, where were we?"</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Neshu</h3>
			<p>Neshu turns, only to blink and face back towards the table. Whatever they had formerly believed vanishes from thought within a moment - as if the memory had been tucked away in an instant.</p>
			<p>Nearby, the soldier Aurelion seems to suddenly relax - though Neshu no longer suspects why.</p>
			<p>He rises from his seat and approaches Neshu, studying them cautiously. "So you are a priest of the Nightbrother? Where is the temple you serve at?"</p>
			<p>Alas, Neshu is so very incredibly confused. About the only thing they could twig to inside of the most recent conversation was Aurelion's question, but the priest's mind is too clouded and empty to know just exactly why.</p>
			<p>So like any good cover, what Neshu - clad in the robes of the clergy - speaks now is the truth. Like any great cover, not even Neshu now knows it to be one.</p>
			<p>"I am a custodian of the Reliquary of Ten Thousand Stars, and the priest-at-service inside of the Temple's calendar rituals. I also help with outreach to the populace, on occasion."</p>
			<p>Besides them, Xownfos takes notice of Aurelion's relaxed posture, and seems to relax a bit more as well, standing straight and taking her hand out from under her cloak. "I get the feeling that everyone here is very, very on edge. Why don't all of you talk about your feelings together? Or at least agree to put international conflicts away from each other? Political views only bring tension to polite conversation."</p>
			<p>"Feelings," says Low, shifting in his spot, "have never been very interesting to me, and I've never been one for politics either. I prefer practical conversation to both."</p>
			<p>He gestures to Neshu. "I believe it is your turn."</p>
			<p>"Perfect!" says the priest, still utterly oblivious. "But first, any final patrons who wish to be dealt in? It'll be far less convenient to enter once the game begins."</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: The Praetorian Order</h3>
			<p>The Praetorian is an elite and secretive order of Imperial soldiers who carry out covert missions for high-ranking Vylmaran authorities.</p>
			<p>Members of the Order operate a wide variety of jobs, serving as assassins, spies, and bodyguards for the Empress and her consuls.</p>
			<p>The Praetorian are also high priests of Daekkan, from whom they supposedly gain their strange abilities. With bodies enchanted by powerful arcane magic, a member of the Order has drastically increased strength, speed, and stamina, as well as incredible amounts of endurance and healing. Although such rumors are widely considered to be myth, some even say the Praetorian have control over shadow itself, being able to supposedly vanish from sight on command and change their appearance with illusory magic.</p>
			<p>Though I must confirm these statements to be to a degree, true, their origin is certainly less divine than many believe.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Luthan</h3>
			<p>At once, a door materializes and is thrown open by a man flourishing an oddly shaped sword. A dark cloak sits loosely on his shoulders above a threadbare robe woven hastily of a fabric that seems colored vibrantly by its nature. The robe is lashed by a strange belt carrying even stranger artifacts. Despite his haphazard and otherworldly attire, he seems in good condition, and his eyes seem to burn with adrenaline as he thrusts the sword forward.</p>
			<p>As the other residents of the bar turn towards him in slight shock, several expressions dance across his face: first realization, then frustration, anger, and curiosity. He sheaths his blade and opens his mouth to ask a question but quickly shuts it, not wanting to make a worse impression for himself.</p>
			<p>He wraps his robe about him, and gives an assortment of coins to the barkeeper, mumbling "get me something unique." The bartender freezes for a moment, trying to process why this dark figure had given it units from at least eight different currencies, only two of which it had ever seen. Instead, it simply leaves them on the counter, and without requesting anything useful in return, begins to prepare something for the man, who had walked to the far corner of the bar and stood there, silent and unconcerned.</p>
			<p>Yet his solitude is soon disturbed as Thedra launches herself from the table, retaining her ungodly speed, and flies in the direction of this newcomer. She lands besides him, arms retracting ever so slightly into her frame.</p>
			<p>"A newcomer! From where do you hail? What is your name? You simply must tell me everything."</p>
			<p>The man removes his hood, intrigued by the peculiar figure.</p>
			<p>"My name depends on who you ask," he says. "I like to call myself Luthan, a name I must have picked up... somewhere...  While the door here may have appeared at a most inconvenient time for me, I am not surprised by it - these things happen often to me. I guess you could call me some kind of interplanetary nomad - I take whatever passages appear in the void between worlds and see what I can learn. Perhaps my interruption was a blessing in disguise. What do you know of this place?"</p>
			<p>Xownfos walks over to Luthan and bows slightly, in a polite manner. "Welcome, Luthan. If you're looking for information, you'd best talk to Neshu. They seem to be the most comfortable with this place. However, the clock over there serves some excellent beverages. Fortunately - or perhaps unfortunately, no poison, but most other liquids."</p>
			<p>Luthan is signaled by the mechanical bartender and takes his first glass of some odd Jossinarian ale. Taking a sip, his eyes immediately widen with surprise, familiarity. He keeps this look of shock as he sets the glass down on the counter louder than he intended, and walks to Neshu. "Where... well, no. This tavern seems to transcend space. Well then... from where did you arrive here? And how?"</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Luthan walked through the streets of a bustling bazaar, his cloak wrapped around him. Though the streams of people and shouts of sellers should have made him hard to find, he sensed his enemy and knew they sensed him too.</p>
			<p>Out of options, he ducked into a dark alley and pulled from his belt a vial of black liquid. He shook it roughly, causing the liquid to begin to glow with a dim light.</p>
			<p>Conveniently, it turned out just bright enough for him to find a trapdoor at the end of the path. As was typical in such a market, the many thieves that frequented it needed their places to hide.</p>
			<p>As Luthan opened the hatch, he heard the unsheathing of a sword behind him. He turned around to see his foe, clad in obscuring black robes, holding a shimmering curved blade trailing threads of magic, to his face. In the air behind him, visible to only his eyes, shone a faint magical projection - the image of a golden shield adorned with two white wings.</p>
			<p>"There you are, miscreant. Stand down and stop this madness. You unravel our plans by solely being here."</p>
			<p>Luthan set his hand on his blade. "You have no right to interfere."</p>
			<p>He ducked and rolled behind his adversary, drawing his weapon at the same time, blocking their blow as they whirled around to stop him.</p>
			<p>"I grow weary of your hypocrisy," he said as he began a vigorous duel with the dark figure. In response, they only gritted their teeth beneath their featureless mask, advancing once more.</p>
			<p>"The Warden never had the strength you claim it does," he taunted, slashing rapidly. The figure parried a few blows before retreating once more.</p>
			<p>"You claim to resist the Sovereign, but what do you do to prove it?"</p>
			<p>"You only derail things further," they responded. "Your recklessness will bring an end to us-"</p>
			<p>Taking advantage of the opportunity, Luthan leapt forwards in a whirlwind of motion and brought his sword to his opponent's chest, edging it closer as they began to breathe heavily.</p>
			<p>"I believe you should be the one to stand down now."</p>
			<p>His opponent, realizing this, jumped gracefully backwards into the passage beneath the trapdoor.</p>
			<p>A strange light flashed from beneath their cloak and they vanished beneath in a sudden burst of speed.</p>
			<p>Luthan gave chase, only wanting an end to the pursuit. He followed his enemy through the labyrinth of winding tunnels below, approaching what he could sense to be a dead end. One more turn, and they would be cornered... the moment his rival turned and slammed the door behind them, Luthan brandished his sword for the final battle, and burst into the Backways Bar.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: Planeshifting</h3>
			<p>Planeshifting is fundamentally simple - it's the exploitation of flaws.</p>
			<p>Flaws are what differentiates nature from machinery - countless tiny differences that ultimately add up to a new identity. Without these flaws, without evolution and learning, we would never be in the same place as we are now.</p>
			<p>Planeshifting works that same way - a happy accident, built on the ultimately flawed concept of space in the Greater Plane.</p>
			<p>There are two main types of planeshifting, both allowing you to instantly transport yourself and nearby objects between points on the Greater Plane.</p>
			<p>The traditional form of interplanar travel is known as fixed planeshifting; it's how the Bar operates. Fixed planeshifting is well, fixed by the will of the Greater Plane, unable to be controlled by the planeshifter. This form of travel is notably difficult to utilize, as planeshifters who use this will have to either search for gateways for long durations of time or hope they're lucky enough to find one by complete happenstance. Common examples of this manifest in the shape of strange doorways, caverns, and for some reason, wardrobes and other such large pieces of furniture.</p>
			<p>More recently, however, the Cult of the Ascendant Sovereign and a few other powerful interplanetary organizations have gained control over a new form of interplanar travel; what's now known as instantaneous planeshifting.</p>
			<p>This form of planeshifting is portable and able to be, in its essence, controlled by the planeshifter.</p>
			<p>Instantaneous planeshifting first requires an interplanar key, a device that can consume energy in order to manipulate spatial boundaries. While many would say this is a significant upgrade from the alternative - there's a catch. Such devices have limited capacity - they can only "remember," or so to speak, a limited amount of locations - to contain so much data in such a small vessel would be essentially impossible. Even the most renowned planeshifters are limited to this constraint - and progress towards finding a way to remove this barrier have only proven even more futile.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Xownfos</h3>
			<p>Xownfos chuckles at the mention of practical conversation.</p>
			<p>"But practicality can't get you everywhere, can it? Connotation is everywhere if you look for it. No one ever says exactly what they mean."</p>
			<p>With a wave of her hand, a chair flies through the room and lands near Neshu's table. "If it's not too much trouble, I'd be interested in playing. I quite enjoyed the card games I tried on the rare occasions I had people to play with. What did you say this game was called again?"</p>
			<p>"Leivas," responds Low. "What song do you sing?"</p>
			<p>"Leivas, you say? It rings a bell, but I can't quite put my hand on it. I suppose I'll try my hand at it. As for singing, I'd consider myself less of a singer and more of a musician, but I do occasionally sing on request. However, I am quite proficient with the flute." </p>
			<p>She leans in towards Low and whispers.</p>
			<p>"You best not advertise your involvement with Jossinarian thieves to everyone. Some might not enjoy your presence. I've seen it first hand."</p>
			<p>Sitting back upright, she continues, "I could care less though. After all, the Jossic have done quite a bit of business with my guild."</p>
			<p>Low smirks.</p>
			<p>"The cant's not very useful at this point anyways, I suppose. I'm not well known, except in my own circles. Perhaps we should see who really cares - I'm not as Low as I am."</p>
			<p>He slowly stands up, and looks around, taking stock of the room once more, briefly. The trader. The priest. The halflife. The conqueror. The planeshifter. And me.</p>
			<p>"I am, in truth, the only One Low the Low One, Founder and Shadow of the Order of the Blade, the final Black Guild. I fought against the lich Irivex, alongside Devarien the Oathbreaker before that was her name, and I survived her betrayal. I am the one who Sees With Shadows, the Madman of Selbrakir, the Elf who Spites the Moon. I am the Consort of Dragons and the Friend of the Rangers, bearer of the Summer Armor and the wielder of the Autumn Knife. I have survived the unsurvivable, escaped the inescapable, and broken the unbreakable. I am the Forsaken Rogue, the Forgotten None, the Arcane Without Mana, the Challenger of Bindings, and though I am also called the Honest Liar, every claim I have made is legitimate, and if you were to ask I could indeed recount some of my tales, though most are centuries old."</p>
			<p>For a moment, the entire room grows dimmer and a bit warmer. The effect fades quickly, and Lohlethean turns back to Xownfos.</p>
			<p>"Unless I've missed a stray pawn or rook, I believe that's checkmate. Will you be playing in this game of Leivas, or should the priest take their turn?"</p>
			<p>Another wave of cold winds wash over Low as Xonwfos tilts her head and replies.</p>
			<p>"You needn't checkmate me," she says. I'd resigned long before the match had begun. But yes, I remember your name. Your attire seemed familiar. However, if you would, explain your title of Honest Liar for me? I've not heard of that one in particular."</p>
			<p>She turns to Neshu. "Another round, perhaps?"</p>
			<p>Promptly, the priest deals Xownfos in, this time using an Ultaric cut. Both Xownfos and Low turn their heads - though the priest doesn't recognize it, card tricks like the extravagant cut they just performed usually took years of training to master. </p>
			<p>"Ah," Low answers, facing back and smirking slightly. "The title of the Honest Liar. There are some who cannot lie, and yet remain dishonest - fey as an excellent example. I lie, and yet remain honest; for example, telling someone that I will steal from them before proceeding not to."</p>
			<p>Xownfos nods.</p>
			<p>"As I've mentioned, I've seen people killed for using thieves' cant. It's quite humorous actually, I believe I once was ordered to try to assassinate you. How small the world is."</p>
			<p>She reaches under her cloak into a pocket and pulls out a small crystal. "Do not misunderstand, you clearly outclass me in rank and power, and this warrant was issued by a corrupt and complacent noble, whose funds I am still draining under the facade of chasing you down." She powers on the crystal, and a notebook made of pure mana appears. She flips through the now tangible pages, eventually seeming to find what she was looking for. Handing the crystal to you, she points to a letter from an Imperial nobleman. "This fool has been handing me a stream of funds for the past three months in hope that I'll by chance happen upon a chance to kill you - or perhaps the one you serve, in cold blood."</p>

			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: On the Yarashe Tongue</h3>
			<p>"Neshu, pas Aventaria." That last bit is a Callname, and roughly translates to "The gatekeeper who prevents the advance of sunset through unwavering faith." It's a piece of poetic irony for a Lunar Priest, and a small nod to Neshu's true affiliation.</p>
			<p>A tongue favored for the more fickle spellcastings, Yarashe is the common language of, funnily enough, most beings who masquerade as celestial entities. Its density of information is such that even High Talemnian weeps, and its most legendary speakers have given lengthy sermons, teachings, and commands in but a single syllable.</p>
			<p>A famous example is the command "KAJ," given by the Bladelord Obath-Jar to his apprentice upon his final death. To this day, the Followers of the Bladelord still ceaselessly work to understand the thousands of subtleties it encodes. No mortal creature can natively speak it, and very few can reach such levels of efficient mastery.</p>
			<p>Occasionally, a monk, priest, or other scholar of Yarashe will dedicate some years of their life to meditating on and composing a Callname, a philosophical statement of identity and intent. Using an ancient, non-binding ritual, they will then graft it to their truest name. Callnames are accepted as surnames in most nations, should the user lack a pre-existing one.</p>
			<p>Personally, I see little point in usage of the tongue myself, but alas, there must be some incentive behind it if those who speak it are so often believed to be divine.</p>
			<p>After all, I'd imagine the true gods I know would laugh at the notion of such a preposterous thing. That is, if they had anything remotely resembling mouths in the first place.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Thedra</h3>
			<p>Thedra's eyes widen to impossible sizes as she hears some words spoken in the conversation behind her.</p>
			<p>"Excuse me. I'll be in a moment."</p>
			<p>She shoots herself over to "Low" as he speaks.</p>
			<p>"Unless I've missed a stray pawn or rook," the elf is saying to the kitsune woman, "I believe that's checkmate. Will you be playing in this game of Leivas, or should the priest take their turn?"</p>
			<p>"Well, that would make sense," Thedra intercuts. "Devarien always was a strong one. I suppose you hid in the shadows while the woman a thousand times your honour fought Irivex?"</p>
			<p>She breathes and continues.</p>
			<p>"Anyway, I have, in fact, heard of some of your titles. You know, some say they're simply used as glue to patch a shattered ego."</p>
			<p>Low's expression is grim as he responds, staring at Thedra without a single movement.</p>
			<p>"Perhaps you'd like to know how that night played out?" he finally says, his voice suddenly rising.</p>
			<p>"After pressing through his armies, Irivex made an offer to both of us. Eternity with power in return for allegiance. I refused, and so naturally, Devarien shot me on the spot, and made the bolt smiting. It caused me one permanent injury, and the two of them left me to die of an agonizing wound. And as for the jab about my many names, I never asked for them, and really, elves generally have frustratingly resilient egos. If mine is shattered as you say, it's probably too damaged for any glue to help."</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Aurelion</h3>
			<p>Aurelion rises from his seat, sensing an opportunity.</p>
			<p>"Let me refill our glasses," Aurelion decides. "I'll pay for us all."</p>
			<p>Before anyone can say otherwise, Aurelion takes the glasses and gives them to the bartender, placing a handful of copper coins on the table. As the bartender moves to refill the drinks, Aurelion takes the communication device out of his cloak and moves out of earshot.</p>
			<p>As he activates the machine, he quickly makes sure that nobody is nearby. His eyes fall on Xownfos first. While he doesn't believe that the kitsune is a threat, she seems to know far too much to be harmless. As with most of the bar's guests, Aurelion believes that he should tread carefully in his dealings with her.</p>
			<p>Augusta's figure manifests in a burst of light atop the device, turning to face him.</p>
			<p>"Has all gone well?" she asks. "You have not been compromised?"</p>
			<p>"They don't seem to notice," Aurelion answers. "I believe we can carry on."</p>
			<p>Augusta nods. "The Praetorian is in place, with a squadron of mages arriving later as reinforcements. The trap is sprung."</p>
			<p>Aurelion inspects the room once more, keeping a steady eye on Neshu. "What do want me to do next? Do you believe the bar's defenses can be broken?"</p>
			<p>Augusta is silent. "It could be possible... and yet, I believe an attempt to be too time-consuming. Better yet to lure the target outside and into the hands of the Praetorian."</p>
			<p>"How do you want me to proceed?" Aurelion asks. "I doubt they trust me enough."</p>
			<p>"Then gain that trust," Augusta instructs. "Act oblivious - perhaps buy them some drinks and act friendly. I am sure you will know what to do when the time comes."</p>
			<p>Aurelion is silent. "I will - but there's one thing I have to ask you first."</p>
			<p>"Yes?" Augusta asks, tilting her head.</p>
			<p>"What will you do with them? I do understand your concern, but what if the suspect is innocent? While I was speaking to them, I couldn't detect a single trace of nervousness - their speech and body language were completely normal. Could we possibly be looking for the wrong person?"</p>
			<p>Augusta sighs, her voice trailing away. "Are you sure you are out of earshot?"</p>
			<p>Aurelion nods. "Yes? Why?"</p>
			<p>"It is time you learned of your purpose in coming here," the Legate says. "You have remained in ignorance long enough."</p>
			<p>Although Aurelion's expression is impassive, his eyes are eager. Was it finally time to find some answers at last?</p>
			<p>"You have come here following a lead - one of utmost importance to the safety of the Empire. You see, three years ago, one of our most trusted spies informed us of a plan circulating deep in the city's underground, detailing a potential heist on the Capitol Vault. Fortunately, we stopped the heist long before it could be enacted, arresting and interrogating most of the criminals involved. What we found, however, had a far greater impact than a simple heist. The thieves had ties to a massive, coordinated rebel movement, one spanning eight different cities and incriminating over thirty different influential figures. We traced each of them down - and this 'Neshu' seemed to be one of the deepest links, as the organization they work for supposedly led to the very core of the rebellion itself. After eight years of interrogating, arresting, and spying, we finally managed to discover another solid lead; the name of a place that Neshu frequented. It is why you are here now."</p>
			<p>Augusta stops, and Aurelion gazes at her with wide eyes.</p>
			<p>He couldn't believe it. He had been the one chosen to do this?</p>
			<p>"You may think that we have drifted apart over time, but you are wrong. I recommended you to Consul Vaexattor, telling him of your exploits in the Arvec campaigns. You have a chance, here and now, to prove your worth-to prove the worth of House Darax. Do not disappoint me."</p>
			<p>Before he can respond, Augusta disappears, leaving him alone. He sits there, mouth agape, for several seconds, as if just processing the information.</p>
			<p>Augusta still cared about him. He had a chance to redeem himself, even after so long.</p>
			<p>Aurelion bows respectfully to the device, his hands shaking on the hilt of his sword.</p>
			<p>He had been issued orders.</p>
			<p>He would not disappoint.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: House Vaexattor</h3>
			<p>Of the Great Houses of Vylmar, House Vaexattor is the oldest, most prestigious - and now, considered the most powerful.</p>
			<p>The Vaexattor motto is "Val Vrago Anaraeth," a Yarashe phrase roughly translating to "The dragon's heart burns bright with the flames of courage."</p>
			<p>The motto has held true since the House's ancient origins, a time predating the Empire itself. The Vaexattors are widely known across Vylmar for their legendary exploits, one of the most famous being Julius Vaexattor's fight and subsequent triumph over the Terror General Ixilscor.</p>
			<p>In fact, many say that the Vaexattors are more akin to angels than men, the distant descendants of celestial beings. And when one takes into consideration the ethereal appearance and luminous glow direct Vaexattor descendants have, such theories do not seem too far from the truth.</p>
			<p>The current head of the Great House is Daerius Vaexattor, one of the five Imperial Consuls and the Empress' personal spymaster.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Neshu</h3>
			<p>At the table, Neshu rises to respond to Luthan's statement.</p>
			<p>"A door," they say, "picked generally at random, to one of the many storage rooms of the reliquary building. I've already spoken at length on this - and I'd ask the same question to you."</p>
			<p>Turning back to the table, Neshu falls back into the role of dealer with instinctual ease.</p>
			<p>"It looks as if all who wish to play have been dealt in! Trump suit this round is..." Neshu sets down one of their cards "...lamps. We will play forward, beginning with Low. The game has now begun."</p>
			<p>The planeshifter nods, gaze locked upon the game as they sit nearby. "...I came through mid-chase from the city of Aruzi in... well, you wouldn't recognize it anyway. I don't know all that much about it either... I just come and go, after all. It's an interesting life, to see much but master nothing."</p>
			<p>Luthan seems to trail off, and returns his gaze to study the brew in front of him on the counter.</p>
			<p>Besides him, the elf Low bites his lips. "There's no point in stalling, is there? He pauses, and then plays a goblet. "Shattering glass."</p>
			<p>"Ahh... foiled," Xownfos replies. "Might as well shoot my foot earlier than later."</p>
			<p>She plays a spear, and promptly draws a card afterwards.</p>
			<p>Low, expression indiscernible, plays a coin from his hand.</p>
			<p>Neshu, lacking the cards to keep their plan up, breaks the chain early. They draw a card before playing a coin.</p>
			<p>"Ante."</p>
			<p>Low plays another coin.</p>
			<p>"Leivas, savagery."</p>
			<p>Without a coin, Xownfos plays another spear and draws a new card in turn.</p>
			<p>"Drawing a poor hand, I see."</p>
			<p>Low smiles, drawing no card. "Unfortunately not."</p>
			<p>Xownfos looks to the other members of the table.</p>
			<p>"By the way, Neshu, I haven't heard your story of discovering the bar. Would you mind sharing with us?"</p>
			<p>"Leivas," Neshu prefaces. "Of course not. Alas, I lack a particularly dramatic story. T'was a month or two ago when I found this place. I had been sweeping the back rooms of the reliquary when a door unexpectedly opened here A few times since then have I returned, but this is my first seeing anyone else."</p>
			<p>Low plays a lamp.</p>
			<p>He takes another glance around the room, but says nothing.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>The Backways Bar</h3>
			<p>As Neshu and the others play, Aurelion makes his way to the counter. He's filled their glasses nearly to the brim with Sjkaldan beer, a concoction notable for its extremely strong smell and distinct taste. After briefly making sure that nobody noticed, in a flash of sudden movement, Aurelion passes his hand over the mug and drops what seems to be several grains of colorful material into the largest drink-a knowledgeable botanist would recognize it as Duskpollen, a tasteless, near-odorless poison that can kill within seconds when consumed in large quantities.</p>
			<p>Fortunately for Neshu, Aurelion doesn't want to kill them - at least not just yet. The few grains of Duskpollen now in the drink are only capable of dazing and fatiguing the consumer for a couple of hours, causing their thoughts to muddle.</p>
			<p>Aurelion hands the glass containing the poison to Neshu and slides the others to Low and Xownfos, respectively. The poison has completely mixed into the drink, and combined with the beer's smell, is effectively undetectable.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Luthan looks around the bar, watching intently as the game of Leivas goes on. His travels have made him a fast learner, and while the cryptic verbal cues confuse him, he at least picks up the objective of emptying the hand, and notices the elf is winning. He sees a swift movement out of the corner of his eye to see Aurelion's hand suspiciously move away from a mug next to him. It cannot be good.</p>
			<p>Though now even more skeptical of the soldier's intentions, he stands silently as the drinks are passed out to the players. He puts his hand on his belt of otherworldly trinkets, not feeling for anything in particular but trying to think of a quick response to what he is afraid might happen next. His fingers finding an engraved stone, some sort of defensive charm, he whips it out as Neshu reaches for the drink, only for its dark surface to glow brightly with the sigil of the Cult of the Ascendant Sovereign.</p>
			<p>The flash of movement immediately draws Low's attention. He finds the centurion sliding a mug towards him - the person from whom the movement came.</p>
			<p>Skjaldan beer.</p>
			<p>Strong smell, strong taste... combined with trust issues, Low's mind goes quickly to poison. He could probably identify it if he could see it alone, but he doesn't really need to.</p>
			<p><i>Kill him! Kill him, you idiot, he wants you dead!</i></p>
			<p>Eh.</p>
			<p>Something... changes. Observant characters would likely notice Low seem to grow dim briefly, as if the lights had flickered, but only for him.</p>
			<p>"I haven't had this in a while. I don't remember liking it, but tastes can change with time. I might see if those bot bartenders serve any kind of food after this game; liquid doesn't go well with empty stomachs."</p>
			<p>He looks Aurelion dead in the eye with a bit of a cold look.</p>
			<p>"No harm in trying things a second time."</p>
			<p>Low gradually drinks the entire mug.</p>
			<p>"Ugh. Now I remember why I haven't tried it for fifty years."</p>
			<p>He pulls a flask of completely black fluid from... somewhere? and takes a drink from it. He flickers dim again.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Aurelion sees Low's eyes light up with realization and nods towards him, motioning for the elf to follow him to the countertop.</p>
			<p>"I'd like to apologize for the secrecy. After all, what is more pure than a simple truth?"</p>
			<p>He lowers his voice to a whisper.</p>
			<p>"I do not intend to kill them. I mean no harm to any of you, even the one that I seek. What I seek is cooperation - the mutual exchange of truths.</p>
			<p>I know that you fight Irivex, elf, you have said so yourself. I believe you; you clearly bear great power.</p>
			<p>And yet, one wonders, why are you not hailed as a hero? Why does the Thrice-Cursed still tread upon Skjaldan soil?</p>
			<p>The Empire is no ally of the living dead. Twenty times Ixilscor and Hekkatae breached our capital's walls, their husks a tide of enveloping death. Twenty times they were rebuffed, with both lichs returned to their graves. The Empress would be honored to aid you in your noble crusade."</p>
			<p>He turns. "How would you like to fight the living dead besides a Vylmaran legion? Besides the Praetorian? I trust that you know of their power. Think, friend, of the choice you will make."</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Low begins to glare. Not extremely, but enough to convey just a bit of spite.</p>
			<p>"Two hundred years. If only corpses could rot past the skeleton, times might be dimmer.</p>
			<p>Irivex has done his best at becoming unassailable. Send an army, and he takes it to replace the damage it deals. Send an assassin, and he just gets back up afterwards. If you have a more specific solution, I might be interested - if not to be done with Irivex, then at least to ruin that traitor, I've already said her name.</p>
			<p>Also, I am not your friend. You are not mine. I'm not impressed by the Praetorians, either; they disgust me for reasons that don't want to be explained.</p>
			<p>And lastly, I'd personally rather that you made your own points instead of getting a story to do it for you, but I suppose some people just can't help that, can they?"</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Luthan puts the stone away swiftly, hoping nobody recognized the sign. Unless his memory lied to him about the ale, they should not.</p>
			<p>Watching Low and Aurelion's discussion, though not entirely listening, he realizes he overreacted to the hand motion. He still doesn't trust the soldier's secrets, but at least he isn't going to kill anyone. That's good enough for him. He takes another sip of his own drink and tries to remember - how long ago was it by now?</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Luthan sat on a wooden chair at the top of an inn overlooking the main street of town. He and another planeshifter like him sat watching the scene, as figures in blood-red robes cut through the crowds toward the tavern down the road.</p>
			<p>"It was inevitable," the man beside him said. Despite seeming young, their hair is lined with faint streaks of silvery gray- giving them away as Talemnian. Even despite their words now, they, Luthan supposed, were amiable enough for someone from that particular world.</p>
			<p>"I suppose, but..." Luthan paused as he saw the priests enter the bar. Silence spread across the once-busy street as people gathered in fear for what would happen. Screams pierced the quietude as the tavern suddenly caught fire, erupting into torrents of flame.</p>
			<p>People scattered as the priests passed unconcernedly back along the road, shouting "We value nothing more than loyalty!"</p>
			<p>By some strange magic, the fire never burned beyond the tavern, and the city was back to normal in moments afterwards.</p>
			<p>"Here. Have this," the traveler said, giving Luthan a bottle of ale.</p>
			<p>"Quite a unique brew," he commented as he drank.</p>
			<p>"Indeed. The world that it's from might be one of the last they haven't touched."</p>
			<p>"Unless we did something about it."</p>
			<p>"You know how I feel about interfering, Luthan."</p>
			<p>"They've interfered enough! Look at all of this!"</p>
			<p>"It is not our duty to protect an 'original timeline' that doesn't exist. Come on. Let's find somewhere else to stay before this inn is accused of treason too."</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Though Thedra has been quiet for some time, upon hearing Low's words, she launches herself at the table at which this game is being played, with noticeably less speed than beforehand.</p>
			<p>"Three things." she says, in a voice quite a bit lower than her normal high-pitched dialect.</p>
			<p>"Primarily, an apology. My behaviour may have been a bit... erratic. You see, I've been hunting down a certain... insurgent - an insurgent against Irivex, of course; there is no point in hiding my allegiance at this point. This insurgent - well, they're sitting right in front of me.</p>
			<p>I'm not powerful enough to get past this goddamn magic wall; hell, I doubt Irivex himself would be - I sense some completely unprecedented power within this thing, so I can't actually kill you here - I've been looking for you for months, and now that I've actually found you, I can't DO anything about it!"</p>
			<p>As she says the word "do", a burst of dark energy erupts from her, knocking everyone at the table back quite a bit. The air around her seems to flicker threateningly.</p>
			<p>"I didn't actually realize that you were the insurgent I was looking for until, well, a couple minutes ago."</p>
			<p>"Secondarily, the unassailability of Irivex."</p>
			<p>She turns to Neshu.</p>
			<p>"How well does scrying magic work against this here tavern? If there was someone attempting to spy on a patron, would there be any form of magical barrier stopping them? I'm not entirely sure how this demiplane works yet, and I can't say too much, for fear that he might be listening."</p>
			<p>"Finally, a question. I'm simply curious - how did you fine folks find yourselves in this establishment?"</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Low turns around.</p>
			<p>"First, killing me is generally harder than people expect it to be. Similarly to tracing me.</p>
			<p>Third... not much to say there. I saw a tavern. I entered the tavern. Now I'm in a tavern. The only weird part is that now I'm in a different tavern than the one I entered."</p>
			<hr>
			<p>As the others speak, Xownfos, seemingly completely oblivious to any potential harm, reaches over and grabs Neshu's glass while the priest is in the midst of playing - and without a second glance, downs the entire drink.</p>
			<p>"They serve Sjkaldan beer here as well? I've not had many chances to enjoy this particular concoction."</p>
			<p>As she finishes the sentence, she instantly falls to the floor, cards flayed out in front of her and seemingly inanimate. In those cards is displayed a majority of spears.</p>
			<p>Before Aurelion's eyes, the bar disappears, a torrent of snowflakes bombarding his vision as a wintry landscape materializes before him. The air is chillingly cold, biting at his skin as howling gusts of wind swirl in a vortex around him.</p>
			<p>Xownfos stands in the midst of the snowstorm, seemingly completely unharmed. Her eyes are as cold as the gusts that sweep and swirl nearby, staring at Aurelion unblinkingly.</p>
			<p>"Tell me, now, pawn, who sent you?"</p>
			<p>Aurelion stumbles backwards, drawing his sword. "What did you do to me?" he shouts. "Leave me at once!"</p>
			<p>"You <i>utter</i> fool. You're playing games that you barely understand. You truly have no clue how deep the water is that you've lost yourself in, have you?"</p>
			<p>Aurelion steps forwards, but to no avail. A gust of wind lifts him off his feet and holds him, unmoving, in the air.</p>
			<p>The kitsune steps forwards. "I find it hard to believe that whoever hired you was this incompetent. You never even <i>questioned</i> what planet the Siannodel guild was from, didn't you? I'd even guess you've never been offworld before."</p>
			<p>Aurelion struggles as she circles him.</p>
			<p>"So tell me now - I'll find out eventually anyways.</p>
			<p>Who was it? The Black Guilds' touches are everywhere here - was it Ranjj? Mar-?"</p>
			<p>She spins around, realization bursting in her eyes.</p>
			<p>"No, no, no. It was <i>them, wasn't it?</i> Of course the Cult of the Ascendant Sovereign hired a catspaw with no knowledge of the greater picture in the first place. Yet they managed to botch their job all the same."</p>
			<p>The pressure around Aurelion increases, wrapping around him and constricting him. He chokes as he flails rapidly, his breath being forced out in rapid jolts.</p>
			<p>"I should just kill you now. You obviously know nothing, and it would do all of us a favor. In fact, I think-"</p>
			<p><b>"No."</b></p>
			<p>Another voice, unfamiliar to the centurion, interrupts Xownfos, causing her to turn rapidly. The winds suddenly stop coursing through the landscape and Aurelion drops to the ground, breathing heavily in half-relief. The words echo through the tundra, amplified dramatically as if somehow coming from everywhere at once.</p>
			<p><b>"I will not have violence here. This place is protected."</b></p>
			<p>Xownfos reaches into her robes and pulls out a strange cylindrical object, gripping it tightly and suddenly firing a bolt of bright light from its tip into the distance. The bolt vanishes into the distance at no avail, and moments later, the woman is suddenly launched away forcefully, vanishing into what seems to be a rift in the very seams of reality itself.</p>
			<p>Around him, the illusion crumbles, snow-covered hills giving way to the familiarity of the bar.</p>
			<p>Xownfos lays on the floor inanimately, breathing softly. The centurion quickly steps away, expression impassive but shaken with panic within.</p>
			<p><i>How? How did she know?</i></p>
			<p>Aurelion steadies himself and inhales deeply. Trying to remain calm, he makes his way to the center of the room, reaching into the folds of his uniform.</p>
			<p>He hadn't been beaten. Not yet.</p>
			<p>In a sudden blur of motion, Aurelion takes out a glass vial and smashes it on the floor, filling the room with a billowing cloud of dense white smoke. Obscured by the vapor, Aurelion reaches into his cloak once again and pulls out one final object from a hidden fold in the fabric - a metal, cone-shaped object with a glowing crimson sigil carved into its surface. Although Aurelion himself doesn't recognize the symbol, Luthan, who's been watching from nearby, does.</p>
			<p>Aurelion quickly slams the cone point-first into the floor beside Neshu, causing the planks to ripple as a shockwave of energy blasts from its center. As energy courses through the room, brought to life in moments, the floor suddenly disappears - turning into open air. Neshu and the chair they sit on tumble into it - and Aurelion, mustering his last ounces of strength, leaps in and follows, vanishing into the rift.</p>
			<p>Before anyone can react, the gateway disappears, the planks mending and reforming. Everything seems to return to normal - save for the disappearance of the two bargoers who had, just a minute ago, been sitting there.</p>
			<p>Luthan is the first to react - he's seen something similar to the device Aurelion used before, in fact, many, on worlds far away. And yet, he's still shocked - the sheer power of the artifact is far beyond anything he has ever seen before. But what scares him the most, however, is the sigil - those two glowing, concentric circles pierced by a crooked line.</p>
			<p>For if the Cult of the Ascendant Sovereign could now create gateways between worlds within so heavily protected areas, then nothing left would still stand in its way.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Low watches as the other players are seemingly removed from play. The smoke was bothersome, but he could deal with it.</p>
			<p>He looks at the table, and then towards Xownfos' "corpse".</p>
			<p>"Guess I win the game then? Unless you're still playing. I think we can count being dropped out of the tavern a forfeit, though, which <i>would</i> make it my turn."</p>
			<p>As if in response, Xownfos appears moments later, surprisingly not unconscious. She stands behind where Aurelion tore open the rift, her expression seemingly surprised and vaguely contemplative.</p>
			<p>"You do," she says absently. "I... have... much to think about."</p>
			<p>She turns towards the door. "I suppose this is farewell. May you be more fortunate in the future, Low."</p>
			<p>As the kitsune opens a door to a snowy tundra, darkness falls over the bar as the lights abruptly flicker out once more. As Thedra appears in front of him, looming in the darkness with her mask slightly loose. A trail of inky black fluid drips down its side as she turns to address him.</p>
			<p>"I know who you are."</p>
			<p>Low laughs cynically. "Do you? That's more than I can say for myself sometimes."</p>
			<p>Thedra continues to stare at him, gaze unblinking behind the mask.</p>
			<p>"Jokes? Do you truly believe those can wipe it away?</p>
			<p>You've done a good job of hiding from yourself. But not good enough."</p>
			<p>Low laughs again, this time even more bitterly. "And what do you think you can do? Help me? Look what you're doing to <i>help</i> the Plane - you still think that miserable old skeleton you call your master is in the right even now?"</p>
			<p>A sudden flash of metal shoots past Low's vision as he's abruptly lifted into the air, dangling in place. The metal claw that grips him by his hood seems to almost emanate coldness as her grip tightens.</p>
			<p>"Do you have any damn idea what is happening around you? Two other planeshifters, maybe more, have scheming amongst themselves all this time! One may have just killed another just moments ago!</p>
			<p>You want to know why? It's because they're preparing - they know as much as you do about what's going to happen next. And when it does, they too know it'll change everything."</p>
			<p>She hisses and continues.</p>
			<p>"You think you can still run away from it all? You think you can run away from <i>me</i>? There's no escape now, not any longer. Accept your fate."</p>
			<p>Low stands in place. "So that's what it was. Of course. You just want me to admit you're right, don't you?"</p>
			<p>He smiles, giving her a hideous, mocking grin.</p>
			<p>"No. I will not."</p>
			<p>Thedra screams in frustration and the vision collapses around him, shadows hurtling inwards to meet him. Low stands firm as the bombardment nears him - then stops as the bar materializes again.</p>
			<p>He turns to Thedra a final time, whose form shakes ever so slightly as she meets his gaze. The voices are stronger than ever now, but he ignores them as he walks up to her and sits down to her front.</p>
			<p>"What of you?"</p>
			<p>Then darkness clouds his vision, the voices reach a crescendo, and he topples over as all fades to black.</p>

			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: The Cult of the Ascendant Sovereign</h3>
			<p>As much as I wish to put this specific matter behind me, I believe it is time to speak of it at last. After all, what use is history if not a traveled path to be learned from and bettered?</p>
			<p>The Cult of the Ascendant Sovereign is not a continental organization. It traces its origins thousands of years back, to, regrettably, the world Talemna, one that you by now may have heard of several times before.</p>
			<p>Despite what some may believe, its very first leader, the titular Ascendant Sovereign, was once mortal; human, as much as I am myself. Though the Sovereign died before the Cult could attain much of its influence now, the organization transcended its leader's death.</p>
			<p>The Cult has long since stopped truly worshiping its Sovereign - its members revere power instead - in all of its forms: influence, control, status. Those highest in rank among them manipulate the desires of those beneath them in their pursuit of the greatest and most terrible form of power available - that which composes reality itself.</p>
			<p>And thus, it is this way that the Cult's grasp extends to the edges of the Plane, holding complete dominion over entire systems of worlds and having strangling roots in others. Power corrupts, and so the corrupt rule.</p>

			<h2>Epilogues:</h2>
			<h3>The Lost</h3>
			<p>Aurelion wakes beside the sea.</p>
			<p>His eyes snap open as he groggily pushes himself up, wiping sand from his uniform. Seabirds call to each other in the distance as the Centurion gasps for breath, inhaling and then exhaling deeply. His clothes are plastered with wet sand, which he brushes off as he rises to his feet warily.</p>
			<p>He immediately reaches into his cloak and feels a sudden sting of pain. As he empties his pockets, the metal shards of the communication device fall out, followed by the cone. While the latter seems to be intact, the glowing symbol etched on its surface has completely faded.</p>
			<p>Aurelion cautiously taps the ground with the cone, feeling it sink deep into the earth. Nothing seems to happen - whatever power the strange artifact had seemed to have been completely drained. It seemed, that like Augusta had said, the machine was truly only a last-resort measure after all.</p>
			<p>He surveys the landscape around him. It's a large, expansive beach, with flat coastline stretching for miles. Trees line the shore around him, their leafy branches waving in the wind. Some have been partially submerged underwater, their roots rising from the bloodred water.</p>
			<p><i>Wait.</i></p>
			<p><i>Red</i> water?</p>
			<p>Aurelion blinks and pinches himself, trying to remain calm. The sea is a vast expanse of crimson, stretching for miles into the distance. Vibrant pink tides crash against the beach, water spraying against rocks in bursts of scarlet.</p>
			<p>Frantically, Aurelion looks up, gazing towards the starry night sky. Two moons, each a faint magenta, gaze back at him.</p>
			<p><i>Regalios help us,</i> he thinks, still unbelieving of the landscape around him. <i>I'm in the fifth hell.</i></p>
			<p>Nearby, Neshu stirs, rising to their feet as well. After a moment of confusion, a shudder travels through their body. Their eyes light up with recognition - which quickly turns to a mix of horror and awe.</p>
			<p><b><i>"Tasnakhaer, Dragonslave."</i></b></p>
			<p>But Neshu already has an answer. Though the tiefling's outer appearance did not change, Aurelion can nonetheless see the countless gouges and prints left by three dozen nameless fears. The demon in front of him has seventeen limbs, three torsos, nine faces, far too many mouths, and a mottled skin that's either pink or black. Or rather both at once.</p>
			<p>But it is the eyes of this gangling beast that demand attention. The loose worldslaw of the hells has torn away any delusions of space, and matter, and feature. Upon every face there is nothing physical where Neshu's eyes should be. There is only pure and undiluted <b><i>truth</i></b>, locked behind a prison of necessity.</p>
			<p>It looks rather painful. This is because it is rather painful. But not as painful as the realization that the human seems to have killed the both of them. The baleful gaze of truth eighteen-fold looms upon the human, tinged - for now - with more curiosity than malice.</p>
			<p><b><i>"Where are we?"</i></b></p>
			<br>
			<h3>The Whisperer</h3>
			<p>Soon, Darius Vaexattor would sit the throne.</p>
			<p>The Consul smiles as he descends the staircase, the dim passageway lit by faint and flickering candlelight.</p>
			<p>Everything had gone to plan - the Empress had blundered again, edging the Empire ever closer to war with Hernan. With tensions already rising near the Jossic border as well, it was only a matter of time before the people would begin to dissent. The throne was almost in his hands, so close and yet still so far away.</p>
			<p>Nearly most of the Empress' guard had been replaced with his men, with more Vaexattor troops stationed in the nearby suburbs. Five Praetorians protected the capital as well, each of which could be easily controlled. When the rebellion truly began, his troops would take the city in the supposed name of the people, allowing him to reign as regent.</p>
			<p>He chuckles softly at the thought. His plan had been in motion for years, and the Empress still knew nothing about it. It had truly been one of her greatest mistakes, appointing him as Imperial spymaster. It was simply so, perfectly fitting that it would now lead to her downfall.</p>
			<p>Darius finally stops, entering a dimly lit circular room. Apart from a large circular metal structure in the form of a table, it is completely bare.</p>
			<p>He makes his way to the structure in front of him and taps on its surface two times, waiting expectantly.</p>
			<p>After a few seconds, a geyser of blue light erupts from the "table," quickly forming into the shape of an ominous cloaked figure. A second stream of red light manifests in the form of two concentric circles, crossed by a curving line. Darius kneels to the ground before rising, his head still bowed.</p>
			<p>"Hail the Sovereign," he begins, still kneeling.</p>
			<p>The figure's voice is low and deep, threatening, with an almost mechanical quality to it. Even now, after years in the Cult, Darius still shivers upon hearing it.</p>
			<p>"High Priest Vaexxator," the figure intones. Its voice drops. "You have failed."</p>
			<p>Darius frowns. "I bring nothing but good news, Great Prophet. The Empire is almost in your hands now, and I assure you, the rest of the continent is soon to follow."</p>
			<p>The figure laughs, a hoarse sound like iron grinding against stone. Darius feels another chill run up his spine. "You have not heard?"</p>
			<p>"Great Prophet?" Darius asks warily.</p>
			<p>The figure is still. "The target escaped. Even your hunter is gone as well. All our remaining links have been severed."</p>
			<p>"With all respect, Great Prophet," Darius begins, his tone almost incredulous, "you cannot possibly be telling the truth. The target was cornered - a Praetorian and a hundred men were sent to do so. They could not have escaped so easily."</p>
			<p>The figure is silent. Eventually, it speaks again, its voice far softer - yet still dangerous all the same. "You have failed."</p>
			<p>Before Darius can act, the light flickers once and then vanishes. The symbol remains, floating in the air almost like a reminder. A warning.</p>
			<p>His breath shaking, Darius stares at the sigil as it slowly fades away. Surprise turns into anger, and he exhales sharply, slamming his fist into the wall with a resounding scream of rage.</p>
			<p>The Prophet spoke truly. He has failed.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Arc 2</h2>
			<h3>The Watcher</h3>
			<p>Another sits in the bar.</p>
			<p>To some, they have sat all this time, constantly present yet evading seemingly all notice, in a dimly lit corner of the bar away from view. To others, they have only recently sat down - though at what time they did so is for some strange reason, unclear. All that is known is that they have sat, and watched, and only now do they finally choose to bestir themselves.</p>
			<p>The figure, who wears a weathered and patched gray cloak, regards the amassed bargoers with a quick, almost calculating series of looks. Before anyone can say otherwise, they sit down at a table in the center of the room, taking their hood off with a strange sort of half-smile.</p>
			<p>The newcomer draws stares immediately. From a first look, they seem to be human-thin and limber, with violet-blue eyes, a sharp nose, and short black hair. Beneath the cloak, they wear a simple slate-gray vest, the cloth stitched from silvery fabric. A leather belt is wrapped around their waist, its compartments displaying a range of strange mechanical devices. Most notably is a silvery tube of metal, bearing what seems to be a smaller cylinder made of wood on one of its surfaces. The figure's hand seems to occasionally stray towards the mechanism, twitching infrequently.</p>
			<p>The figure inspects the room again - and for a single second, their eyes seem to flicker from brown to green and then to blue again.</p>
			<p>But it isn't their eyes that draw the bar's attention - it's the metal patch stitched onto the figure's vest - a symbol glowing faintly with scarlet light.</p>
			<p>Luthan and Thedra immediately freeze at the mere sight of it. They've seen it before; so, so many times. Memories abruptly flash through their minds, their bodies abruptly tensing almost by instinct.</p>
			<p>The symbol? Two concentric circles, crossed by a single crooked line.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: The Ascendant Sovereign</h3>
			<p>In truth, the man who founded the Cult never intended to create such a vast system of subjugation and dominion. Even the most terrible among us are still ultimately people, after all, and the one now called Sovereign was no exception - in fact, he is one of the few men I still admire even to this point.</p>
			<p>Instead of power, the Sovereign first pursued change - the ability to remake his dying world for the betterment of its peoples. Though he would unleash a force beyond his control in the end, his pursuit was a sincere one in fundamentality - far more than what I can say for some.</p>
			<p>But I will speak no further of him now. After all, to truly address his life-you must speak of <i>hers</i> as well.</p>
			<p>And of course, mine.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Endistic</h3>
			<p>A door appears in the middle of the bar, and then vanishes moments afterwards. Flickering back and forth into existence, it begins to glow with a swirl of arcane symbols that appear and circle around it, expanding and brightening as they fill the room with dancing patterns of violet light.</p>
			<p>Finally, after several moments, the door stabilizes - and a tall figure walks out, tall and obsidian-skinned with a pair of bright violet eyes. A young Enderian man, as Luthan notes, walking tentatively in a circle with head bowed. A strange metal tablet, glowing with a neon magenta radiance, is held in his hand, which, after a single tap, causes the door to abruptly melt into the floor and vanish.</p>
			<p>Another tap, and a metal box-like apparatus manifests from behind him, formed of the very same purple light. He slowly makes his way towards the machine, standing beside it almost protectively.</p>
			<p>"So... this is the bar," he mutters into the device as the onlookers watch with expressions ranging from intrigue to horror. "I think I'm at the right location."</p>
			<p>He raises the tablet to the side of his face, seemingly ignorant of the bar's patrons despite their questioning glances.</p>
			<p>"Can you hear me?" His brow is wrinkled as he stands in place for a few minutes, then walks, still muttering softly, to a table.</p>
			<p>"Unless I did this wrong... no, it's the right directory... we should be good. Now - where..."</p>
			<p>He stops mumbling and sits down, waving to a clockwork bartender nearby.</p>
			<p>"Ah," he speaks into the tablet, nodding. "I see," he adds. "Well, I'll be waiting here in that case."</p>
			<p>With a quick motion of his hand, he taps the device a final time and it dims, its surface turning black. The box collapses into itself, fading into a speck of violet that lengthens and stretches into the device he holds.</p>
			<p>Before the man can speak to the bartender, a shadow falls upon the floor behind him as Thedra appears, gazing at the device with curiosity in her eyes. "The drinks here are free, y'know," she says, turning her gaze up with voice peppy once more. "They can get you <i>whatever you want!</i> This place is the greatest, isn't it?"</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: Enderia</h3>
			<p>To speak of the Plane without mentioning Enderia is folly. Though far in distance from the central worlds of the Inner Ring, the Enderian system is nonetheless important, whether due to its pioneering advancements in planeshifting, unimaginably developed technology, or its rich and diverse cultures. While the other worlds fight for control of their claims to the Plane, Enderia is isolated - but strong in their solitude, waiting and watching patiently as they grow in power.</p>
			<p>Though I must admit now that the reason why the system has come into such importance here falls ultimately upon, well, me.</p>
			<p>After all, I did kill its god.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Luthan</h3>
			<p>Luthan breathes heavily as he sits, still reeling from the shock of the last few minutes.</p>
			<p>Two patrons had just vanished before his very eyes, one possibly killing another in the process. Another had just arrived - an Enderian, most of all; one of the Plane's most reclusive and yet powerful peoples.</p>
			<p>A fourth had seemingly fallen unconscious - and of course, a newcomer with the familiar symbol he's also seen more times in the past few minutes than any single day on any of the worlds they controlled had arrived as well. What had truly happened for such a thing to occur?</p>
			<p>He wants to find out more about all of them - he'll feel safer that way - but chooses to avoid staying in the open for now. He slowly makes his way towards the Enderian man, nodding respectfully in greeting.</p>
			<p>Where does he begin? "Greetings," he says. "I notice you came here on purpose... may I ask why?"</p>
			<p>The Enderian seems startled as he glances back from his conversation with Thedra.</p>
			<p>"You asked?" he says. "To speak simply, I…need a break. Yes."</p>
			<p>Luthan smiles politely. It was not the full truth-his nervousness gave him away; but he seemed sincere enough.</p>
			<p>"These are difficult times," he answers. "I am Luthan."</p>
			<p>"My name is Endistic," the Enderian responds, voice still edged with nervousness. He glances around the bar before continuing.</p>
			<p>"Endistic... Akarah."</p>
			<p>Luthan's eyes widen as he instinctively steps backwards, reeling in sudden shock. His mind begins to churn once more as realization slowly sinks in.</p>
			<p><i>Akarah.</i></p>
			<p>He knew that last name - in fact, few planeshifters as traveled as him didn't. This was no ordinary planeshifter - he spoke to the prince of all Enderia itself, according to rumors, a fearsome warrior and brilliant strategist that had planned the dethronement of the tyrant Lakotas.</p>
			<p>The Enderian sighs and nods as if reading his reaction.</p>
			<p>"There's no need to bow," he says, waving his hand. "I'm no heir - Enderia no longer has a king for the first time since before the ascension of Xyraith himself. I suppose I'm a clanmaster... but for now, I'd prefer you draw little attention to the topic here."</p>
			<p>Luthan nods slowly, ignoring the initial wave of shock. "It is wise to be wary of power. Welcome to the Backways Bar," he says, mind still whirling. "I think you'll find yourself quite at home here."</p>
			<p><i>Akarah</i>, he continues to think. Was everyone here far more than they seemed? What truly was this place and why had it brought them all here?</p>
			<br>
			<h3>The Madman</h3>
			<p>Low watches, barely cognizant, as another door opens and another person steps through.</p>
			<p><i>I... could do it... I have enough left...</i></p>
			<p><i>killitkillitkillit</i></p>
			<p><i>Or... I could recall... if only I could...</i></p>
			<p><i>killkilkillkilkillkillkillkillkill</i></p>
			<p><i>Replace my supply...</i></p>
			<p><i>I'll run out soon, I... have... to... choose...</i></p>
			<p><i>kill it kill it now <span style="color:palevioletred;">kill them all you can't trust them</span> <span style="color:crimson;">you can't trust anyone you can't trust them until they're all dead you can't trust them until their bodies are burned destroy every single last one of them.</span></i></p>
			<p><i><b><span style="color:darkred;">Kill her.</span></b></i></p>
			<p>Suddenly, in a rapid, jerking motion, Low rises, muttering to himself as his eyes roll over and glaze.</p>
			<p>"I... no... can't... the scr - no... wo...n't... whh... cards... the...cards... wh... where... gone... too... far... I... went... too... far... now... they... will... now... they... kill... why... die...?"</p>
			<p><i><b><span style="color:darkred;">death death death death death death death death death death death death death</span></b></i></p>
			<p>"make it... stop... please... i-ca...n't..."</p>
			<p>Low's left hand shudders, dragging out the flask of black liquid from before. However, his hand spasms as he holds it up to his lips, causing him to drop it on the floor and shatter.</p>
			<p>"can't... make... it... stop... them... stop... voi...ces... stop... make... them..;. P;lea;se?"</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Eoc</h3>
			<p>Light blossoms from a newly opened doorway, blasting into the bar and filling the newcomers' sight with expanding rays of radiance. The light fades after moments, and a man, dressed in robes that have clearly seen better days, bursts through the door and collapses on the ground.</p>
			<p>Eyes from across the bar immediately turn to the newcomer. His glaive, fallen beside him, is bloody and chipped, his half-bare chest laden with scars.</p>
			<p>The temperature of the room suddenly changes rapidly, the air itself turning bitterly cold for a second as icy crystals form on the man's wounds.</p>
			<p>A cough splits the air as the man begins to breathe, robes mending as he slowly stands. He looks up for a second before an expression of utter horror makes its way across his face.</p>
			<p>"YOU!" he shouts in Low's direction. "WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME?!"</p>
			<hr>
			<p>The wind blows through Eoc's hair as sunset approaches. Nearby, Axyle closes up the shrine, clearing the altar and sweeping the floors.</p>
			<p>The sounds of the distant city grow quieter by the minute, and Eoc sets himself in a kneeling pose beneath the statue of Thalaik above. It was time to meditate and record his nightly communion - all becomes silent as he closes his eyes and unattunes with all around him.</p>
			<p>A sudden scream of shock abruptly pierces the calm, causing Eoc to turn in surprise and dispel the trance moments afterwards. It sounds again; and he recognizes the voice as Axyle's. What had just happened?</p>
			<p>"Father Eoc! Help!" the voice calls a final time, this time even weaker than before.</p>
			<p>In a flash of motion, Eoc summons his glaive, dashing into the next room. His disciple lies on the floor nearby, motionless in a pool of spreading blood.</p>
			<p>Eoc turns as three masked men drop down around him, each armed with a dagger and shortsword. A fourth, carrying the sigil of a red knife on their cloak, moves to bar the doorway, lifting their hood to reveal a bald head and angular face.</p>
			<p>It was as he feared. The Black Guilds had come for him at last.</p>
			<p>"Sevrien," Eoc growls as the man draws a curved scimitar. "I told you I wanted no harm to come to my disciples."</p>
			<p>"Too late," Sevrien smiles, revealing a mouth filled with pointed teeth. Three shadows splinter off him as he approaches, materializing into identical copies of himself.</p>
			<p>"Come, priest. Let us dance."</p>
			<p>Yelling in rage, Eoc blasts Sevrien with a wave of ice, striking him directly in the chest. Sevrien fades to smoke moments later, revealing a puff of shadow where the clone had formerly been.</p>
			<p>Eoc groans and runs, striking another assassin in the chest with his glaive as he backs away towards the door. Sevrien advances ever-steadily, gliding along the floor towards him.</p>
			<p>Opening a door in front of him, he dashes in, sealing it with another bolt of ice, and...</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Enderae</h3>
			<p>The door opens to the Backways Bar, creaking slightly on its hinges. A hooded, cloaked figure steps through, his face obscured in shadow as dark as his skin. The only thing visible are a pair of glowing magenta eyes. Talk pauses for a moment as the other patrons of the bar turn around in their chairs to look at him, their glasses momentarily forgotten. Then they turn back to their food and drinks, chattering and laughing just like before. The figure looks around him. Figures, different as night and day, sit together, shoulder to shoulder, chuckling and talking to each other, food and drink sitting on crowded, clustered tables. Machinations of metal and steam and glass passing up various snacks and drinks, clockwork cogs whirring and whizzing as plumes of steam waft up from them.</p>
			<p>The wanderer weaves his way through the tavern, dodging people and machines alike, threading his way through crowded tables with laughing inhabitants, none of whom look up at him. He makes his way to the bar and looks a mech in the eye.</p>
			<p>"A glass of fresh chorus juice, please." he says with a slight, indeterminable accent. The mech slowly places its glass of liquid on the bar, which is received by a chuckling, clearly drunk human clad in red leather head-to-toe, then looks at the wanderer and nods. It stoops down, grabs a crate of chorus fruits, and places it on the table. Turning on the tap, it gives itself a cursory wash of its hands, and turns it off. Its metal hands still dripping with water, it grabs a chorus fruit in each four hands and a glass in the fifth, then squeezes the purple juice into the glass by hand. It repeats the process until the glass is completely full, throwing away the emaciated, squeezed fruit into another crate and grabbing more from the one on the table. It shoves the glass over to the wanderer, who takes it with a nod.</p>
			<p>"Thanks." says the wanderer over his cloaked shoulder, as he makes his way to a dark, dim corner of the tavern.</p>
			<p>The mech does not respond. As if nothing had happened, he begins pouring more glasses of manifold liquids from dusty pitchers and casks and handing them to its customers without a word.</p>
			<p>The wanderer pulls out his chair, as it grates on the rough wooden floor, sits down, and pulls out an oddly blue quill and a sheet of parchment. Taking a sip of his purple, slightly luminescent juice, he smacks his lips, smiles, and begins to write leisurely in Voidic, oblivious of all happening around him, as he writes and sips, writes and sips, writes and sips.</p>
			<p>The wanderer looks up from his paper and stares across the room, where a group of people were chatting. He squints at them from under his hood, and sees a familiar face. A smile cracks his solemn features, and he rises from his seat, taking his cup of chorus juice and his paper with him. Unseen, his black cloak and hood melt into the shadows of the tavern. A shadow seems to split from the dark corners of the room, and glides behind Endistic, tapping him on the shoulder.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Luthan</h3>
			<p>The stranger too notices Luthan's look of surprise. After Endistic leaves, they smile and raise their arms with a look of obviously feigned disbelief.</p>
			<p>"It's true," they say. "I'll admit it now. I am exactly what you've been running away from all this time; an associate, if you will, of the Cult of the Ascendant Sovereign.</p>
			<p>They extend a hand. "But call me Calennius," they say. "I'd rather have us begin on relatively friendly terms, won't you agree?"</p>
			<p>Before Luthan can speak, they continue, their expression now vaguely curious. "And you, planeshifter, don't exactly need to introduce yourself. My associates are looking everywhere for you, and that's not just a figure of speech. It's quite the stroke of fate, isn't it? I came to take a break from the madness, and yet here you are."</p>
			<p>Luthan tenses as the stranger moves to take a seat. They watch him silently, gaze expectant as he stands unmoving in careful contemplation.</p>
			<p>What could Calennius want from him?  They can't be there to hurt him - the bar's defenses would have made sure of that, though Aurelion had gotten away with it outside, using an artifact they may well have. The Cult knew about the bar, probably because of whatever the soldier had done with his communication device! Who can he trust anymore?</p>
			<p>And they know him so well too... why have they followed him? He may have opposed them, but he hadn't made a major move to impede their plans, not yet. Do they want to recruit him for their cause? They can't be foolish enough to think he'd accept, unless they had a plan. But of course they had a plan. Or is he overreacting again? What is he going to do?</p>
			<p>"Two more," he tells the mechanical bartender, and sits down. He might as well - play along, see where this goes, and prepare for the inevitable.</p>
			<p>What choice did he truly have?</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Endistic</h3>
			<p>Endistic jumps backwards, seeing an ever-familiar face. It was Enderae. His lifelong friend. He had helped him. Killed him. Revived him. Slew a king. Established order.</p>
			<p>And he was here at last for their most crucial endeavor yet.</p>
			<p>"Oh, hello!" he says nervously. "You seem to fit in quite well here."</p>
			<p>"I visit this place every week," Enderae chuckles as he takes off his hood. "I was quite surprised when this place was selected by the contact."</p>
			<p>"This is my first time here," Endistic says, glancing around. "I do have to say it's a bit... foreign."</p>
			<p>Enderae winces, seeing the dirty looks passed their way.</p>
			<p>"Hey, we- uh, we didn't mean anything by it." he says, raising his hands in the air as they both walk to a secluded table. As they sit down, Endistic sets his drink on the table. On its smooth surface is a cup full of stirrers, a ketchup bottle, and a mustard bottle, along with an assortment of many interdimensional condiments. Looking at his drink and frowning slightly, he grabs a stirrer and stirs it.</p>
			<p>"So how do we begin?"</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Calennius</h3>
			<p>Calennius whispers something to the bartender, and within a few minutes, the automaton hands a glass of strange red liquid to them. Calennius pushes one of the drinks to Luthan, taking a sip of the other. "I'm truly glad we came to an accord there."</p>
			<p>They pause, taking another sip.</p>
			<p>"What do you seek, Luthan? I speak as a fellow planeshifter; a weary traveler, tiring but not just tired yet, who's seen far and lived far longer than they should."</p>
			<p>"I've known many who travel for power. Is that what you seek? To be hailed as a ruler of worlds, worshipped fervently in temples of your own make. Is it wealth? To collect riches from across the Greater Plane, countless invaluable treasures in every size and shape?"</p>
			<p>They shake their head. For a second, Calennius meets Luthan's eyes, their gaze deep and knowing. In those shifting depths, Luthan sees a multitude of possibilities and realities - hundreds of thousands of collected truths, libraries worth of accumulated knowledge.</p>
			<p>He nearly reassesses his judgement of the cultist then and there. No, they weren't a simple power-bent or fervor-driven acolyte of the Sovereign; far from that. Whatever they wanted; Luthan knew it was far beyond him to piece together just yet.</p>
			<p>"No," Calennius says, surprising him. "You are an earnest man. You simply want to preserve - is that not it? A noble cause, with great reason for doing so."</p>
			<p>Their eyes change to a turquoise blue. "And yet, consider what you speak of again. By stopping those who bring change, do you not bring change yourself? Is trade - interaction between societies - not a fundamental tenet of civilization?</p>
			<p>What I myself seek is simple. I do not want power, nor status, nor wealth. Passion, progress, even curiosity have all long lost their appeal.</p>
			<p>No. I only wish for one thing. Death, you see, comes to all eventually. We may believe we have escaped it, but it lays its cold hands on us all the same, catching us whether with surprise or acceptance. I do not want to cheat death - to do so would be foolish. No. When it comes for me, faceless and looming, I want to stare into its gaze and know I won."</p>
			<p>Calennius sets the drink on the table. It is now completely empty.</p>
			<p>Luthan reassesses his judgment of the other planeshifter silently. They've surprised Luthan yet again. Were they truly what they seemed, or simply something else entirely? While they give him the same lecture he's heard from others he met on his otherworldly travels, they seem different from the others...</p>
			<p>"If you disagree, why do you follow them?"</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Eoc</h3>
			<p>Low begins shuddering as Eoc addresses him, his gaze still unfocused.</p>
			<p>"Stop-th;the;-s;c;c;c/c;ream;s. Please!"</p>
			<p>Moments pass, and his head jolts up sharply, causing Eoc to step back. Staring directly at the newcomer with haunted eyes, he stops shaking and speaks, his voice resounding with a sudden echoing tone</p>
			<p><i>"Who are you?"</i></p>
			<p>Eoc gathers a deep breath. Dropping the glaive, which vanishes into shards of ice, he grabs a stool and sits next to Low. "I am the Father of True Ice, and you took everything from me."</p>
			<p>After a short moment, a look of recognition flashes in Low's eyes.</p>
			<p><span style="color:darkorange;">"You. Killed him. Kill me."</span></p>
			<p>His armor bursts into flame, and Low suddenly stops moving, barely even seeming to breathe as he looks off into space.</p>
			<p>The broken flask is still at his feet.</p>
			<p>Eoc snorts in response, breaking into a soft grim laugh. "I will not strike down a man at his lowest," he says. "You have much to answer for, and you will do me no good dead."</p>
			<p>Low ignores him, shaking rapidly once more. "Do it. Do it!"</p>
			<p>Eoc's breath comes out in a trailing sigh. "May Thalaik have mercy on your soul." Slowly, he raises his hand and weaves together a web of delicate clinging frost, carefully pressing it to Low's forehead. Eoc's eyes close and he breathes in deeply as the coat of ice extends cold, gentle, tendrils around the elf. The man's brow furrows and his breathing quickens in concentration.</p>
			<p>Moments later, the ice suddenly glows red with heat and it shatters into splintering pieces, leaving Eoc to stagger backwards in surprise. His expression is visibly surprised as he reassesses the elf, who now slumps over upon his chair unmovingly.</p>
			<p>"You…no…" he mutters, clenching his teeth. "I will not let you get away just yet."</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Thedra</h3>
			<p>As Luthan speaks, a shadow clambers across the wall and Thedra appears at Calennius' side.</p>
			<p>Her posture is a little more uptight and her voice a little less slurred.</p>
			<p>"Now, I ain't no philosopher," she says, "but I <i>am</i> curious. What exactly d'you mean, 'won'? I mean, what do ya gotta do to 'win' against death? Me personally, I'd say escaping it is the damn best thing one can do."</p>
			<p>Calennius smiles.</p>
			<p>"That, my friend, is what another just like you once believed.</p>
			<p>Let me tell you a lie."</p>
			<p>"All stories are lies in the end. Even ones founded in truth are inherently biased, filled with countless tiny lies that we tell ourselves in order to maintain the appearance of the facade we live in. Lying has become a part of life, society itself a great hoax founded on the many fragile fronts that we attempt to maintain.</p>
			<p>Lying, yes, is a part of life. And contrary to what many of you believe, it will always be.</p>
			<p>You see, a lie is not a sin. After all, is a story an act of sin, fooling you into believing a lie for the duration of the time you spend reading it?</p>
			<p>The truth is, lies are simply tools - they can be used for harm, for good, for a multitude of purposes and reasons. And even the most fragile of lies are still founded in truth; behind every lie, there is a person, a swirling vortex of hopes, experiences, and motives.</p>
			<p>So, if you have the patience to hear a story, the humility to believe a lie, the will to seek a truth, then listen on. For, if you happen to be lucky, perhaps you'll find truth there in the end.</p>
			<p>Now, without any further words, let us begin.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Long ago, so very long ago, in a distant land in a distant time, there lived an alchemist.</p>
			<p>The alchemist was dying. His experiments had rendered him frail and weak, as thin as a weathered branch and almost as prone to snapping in the wind.</p>
			<p>Every morning, when he woke up, he would see Death looming behind him, cloaked and hooded, a faceless being with axes as sharp and cold as ice. Every morning, it seemed to inch ever closer, creeping towards him with its skeletal hands outstretched.</p>
			<p>The alchemist knew his time was running out. He felt its touch upon his shoulders; saw its frozen gaze reflected in his own eyes. Soon, he knew he would be sent to the stars for his final judgement.</p>
			<p>But the alchemist would not give up - at least not yet. He knew he would fight, struggling against Death with every ounce of life he still had. He would not die, not yet.</p>
			<p>The alchemist first made his way to the foothills of the tallest mountain in the world. Struggling for breath and shivering in the cold, he began to climb, battered and wracked by howling gales of frigid wind. With his last few breaths, he crawled to the highest peak, collapsing to the snowy ground.</p>
			<p>Here, so far up atop the mountain peak, the alchemist could touch the very sun itself. And so, his voice ragged and weak, he began to speak.</p>
			<p>"Sun, oh, bright, radiant sun, giver of life and protector of all living things, hear my plea.</p>
			<p>I have traveled for countless miles, a humble pilgrim driven by faith alone, to feel your light. All I ask of you now is a single boon - to live, blessed by your warmth, to the ends of eternity."</p>
			<p>"Pilgrim," the sun spoke, its voice as warm as a thousand rays of light. "What you seek cannot be fulfilled so simply. Life must be paid for with life in turn, a great sacrifice made for a greater blessing."</p>
			<p>And pay the alchemist did. When he strode out into the sunlight, he stood tall and revitalized, freed from Death's clutches as long as the sun shone in the sky. But life must be paid for with life in turn, and afterwards, no heart would ever beat in his chest again.</p>
			<p>But the alchemist would not stop just there. As the sun slowly fell from the sky and the heavens turned dark, the alchemist felt Death's grim touch once more. As life drained from his body, he entered a small clearing, stopping beside a clear pool of water.</p>
			<p>There, reflected in the water's surface, was the full moon, its image perfectly mirrored in the depths. Before Death could reach him, he began to speak again.</p>
			<p>"Moon, oh, beautiful, elegant moon, weaver of dreams and maker of miracles, hear my plea. I have climbed mountains and crossed deserts, a humble pilgrim driven by faith alone, to witness your majesty. All I ask of you now is a single boon - to live, shielded by your gaze, to the ends of eternity."</p>
			<p>"Pilgrim," the moon spoke, its voice as soft as a midnight breeze, "What you seek cannot be attained so easily. Only the highest of prices can pay for the greatest of miracles. For one heart to beat, another must stop."</p>
			<p>Once more, the price was paid. When the alchemist rose again, his chest held high, he stood tall and revitalized, freed from Death's clutches for as long as the moon watched from the void above. But from then on, the flame of his soul would be forever dim.</p>
			<p>But the alchemist had one more step to take. Across the world he traveled, crossing deep seas and blooming forests, desolate plains and lush valleys. Years passed, and after what seemed to him like an eternity, he finally arrived at a beautiful temple, its dome painted with a thousand bright stars.</p>
			<p>The alchemist waited until nightfall, watching as the sun fell and the moon rose into the sky. At the day's final hour, he entered the temple, standing beneath the star-speckled roof.</p>
			<p>The stars had come alight with a brilliant radiance, their patterns trailing blazing streams of light across the dark roof. As the alchemist watched, the stars flickered into being one by one, forming blossoming nebulas and spiraling galaxies.</p>
			<p>The alchemist had seen much on his travels - he had explored every corner of the earth. But this was simply something else - here, the very heavens themselves seemed to touch the mortal plane, as if the temple was an open doorway into the thousand worlds beyond.</p>
			<p>Trying to calm himself, he bowed low to the floor and began to speak.</p>
			<p>"Stars, oh, majestic, glittering stars, guardians of spirit and painters of skies, hear my plea. I have journeyed across the world, a humble pilgrim driven by faith alone, to bask in your brilliance. All I ask of you now is a single boon - to return, warded by your mantle, from the ends of eternity."</p>
			<p>"Pilgrim," the stars spoke, their voices synchronized in perfect harmony. "What you seek cannot be attained so easily. A final price you must pay; for to escape death, one must first give themselves to it.</p>
			<p>So the final price was paid. To the sun the alchemist gave his heart, to the moon his soul, and to the stars his body.</p>
			<p>But the alchemist had not truly been defeated. With the power he had gained, he carved a new heart from stone, fashioned a new soul from flame, wrought a body from iron and ice. He had won - outmaneuvered the gods, cheated Death itself, escaped beyond the ends of eternity.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Listener, you may be content to stop here, satisfied at last. I do not blame you - a happy ending is what you've come here looking for, isn't it? You know you want me to say it - that the alchemist lives contently for the rest of his life, having to never fear Death again.</p>
			<p>And yet, a word of advice. There are few happy endings in reality - the truth is almost always far from what you want it to be.</p>
			<p>You see, we all crave lies; one would much rather live a shallow, idealistic fantasy than confront harsh reality. It is our nature - we are purposefully ignorant of the horrors around us, our very beliefs censored by a barrier of our own making.</p>
			<p>I do not blame you - lies are fundamental parts of life, after all - I have said so myself. But, if truth is what you really seek in the end, then let me advise you - do not stop now. Have patience, and let me tell you of the true end to this tale.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>For the next few days, the alchemist reveled - celebrating his victory. No longer would Death stalk behind his heels, no longer would age drag him down, slowly weathering his body and mind. His new body had everything he wanted - a soul that burned, a heart in his chest, a body thrice as strong and a mind thrice as sharp. He had attained the very shape of perfection - a form crafted by the cosmos itself.</p>
			<p>And yet, for some reason he could not fully explain, he was not satisfied.</p>
			<p>His heart beat, yes, but it was the beat of rock upon metal, a hollow and empty pulse. His soul was warm - the warmth of a flame, which seemed to devour and gnaw at his conscience, craving constant sustenance to stay lit. And his body was cold - strong and resilient as steel and sharp as shards of ice - yet still bitter, heavy and frigid to the touch.</p>
			<p>Days passed, and the alchemist felt himself grow ever more unsatisfied. He had gained power now - great power, unmatched in almost every regard, but still nothing compared to the passion of a human spirit.</p>
			<p>Finally, the alchemist decided that it was simply unbearable. What was the point of eternal life, after all, if one lived as a husk, almost more object than man?</p>
			<p>Setting out once more, the alchemist climbed the Mountain of the Sun in thirty strides, making his way to the peak once more.</p>
			<p>"Sun," he shouted into the sky. "I have made a great mistake, and now I recognize the error of my ways. Give me back my heart and let me live the rest of my life, mortal but content."</p>
			<p>But the sun would not speak. The alchemist waited atop the peak for three days, waiting desperately for a reply.</p>
			<p>Finally, on the dawn of the fourth day, the sun rose again.</p>
			<p>"You have made your choice," the sun spoke, voice booming and resonant. "There is no turning back."</p>
			<p>The alchemist begged and pleaded, but the sun would not speak again. With a heavy heart, he descended the mountain as night began to fall.</p>
			<p>It was midnight when the alchemist arrived at the Lake of the Moon. Bowing low to the ground, he gazed into the crystalline waters and began to speak once more.</p>
			<p>"Moon," he cried into the pool. "I have made a great mistake, and now, knowing the wrongs I have done, I confess and repent my sins. Give me back my soul and let me live the rest of my life, mortal but content."</p>
			<p>The moon did not reply. For three more days, the alchemist waited, the last vestiges of their hope slowly draining away.</p>
			<p>Finally, on the dusk of the third day, the moon spoke again.</p>
			<p>"You have made your choice," the moon said, voice soft yet frigid. "There is no turning back."</p>
			<p>The alchemist beseeched and implored, but the moon would not say a thing again. His insides twisting with despair, he crossed the lake before the sun rose.</p>
			<p>Two more days passed, and the alchemist finally returned to the Temple of the Stars. Falling on his knees before the ceiling, he began to plead, his tears falling like a shower of rain upon the floor.</p>
			<p>But the stars would not show themselves. For three days once more he stayed, waiting ever more desperately beneath the magnificent roof.</p>
			<p>And then, at midnight of the third day, the alchemist finally got a response.</p>
			<p>A sudden, sharp coldness made its way across his body, causing him to shiver uncontrollably in response. The alchemist turned sharply, freezing in place as he saw the figure beside him.</p>
			<p>Death stood behind him, clad in raven-feather robes. While one of its skeletal hands bore a jagged axe, raising it above its cowled head, the other rested on his shoulder, as cold to the touch as the essence of a winter storm.</p>
			<p>"I won," the alchemist said, his voice a mere whimper. "This cannot be. I won."</p>
			<p>Death finally began to speak, its voice empty and hollow, devoid of all pitch and emotion. "You did."</p>
			<p>"You have become me."</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Calennius stops, gauging her reaction. Thedra sits there, a contemplative but confused look on her face. She opens her mouth as if to ask a question, and then closes it and shakes her head.</p>
			<p>Eventually, she speaks.</p>
			<p>"I... I had never heard that story before. I suppose I never did wonder why folks all called him 'thrice-cursed'.</p>
			<p>So, your goal is to become one of the deathless, like Irivex?" she asks, accent becoming less pronounced as she speaks.</p>
			<p>"The tale makes it seem like not too pleasant of an experience. Irivex always did seem remorseful, to a certain extent.</p>
			<p>I suppose it makes sense he had no soul."</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: To Be Divine</h3>
			<p>Irivex is no god - he simply paints an excellent facade of it instead. Each spoken legend enforces the myth, reinforces and strengthens it, until every mention of his name becomes reverent and fearful.</p>
			<p>But of course, Irivex is far less legendary than he seems. He does not despise life - rather, he craves it, and his "wars on the living" are in truth "wars on those who oppose his dominion" instead. Even divine, Irivex's facade is a mask, hiding the coward within - and like all others of his ilk, when the storm truly comes, his facade finally breaks and shatters in the face of it all.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Permafrost</h3>
			<p>A metal door opens in a corner of the bar, aglow with flickering neon lights that expand and fill the room with dancing spots of light. It slowly slides open and a young man in rich yet odd clothing steps out, his expression startled as he surveys his surroundings.</p>
			<p>"This has been here the whole time?" he says to nobody in particular. "I... nevermind."</p>
			<p>They look around the room, and pause momentarily.</p>
			<p>"Oh, that's not good. I'll just..."</p>
			<p>They turn around to find the door suddenly gone. Panic makes its way across his expression, which he eventually dispels with a deep breath moments later. "Erratics, what's going on here?"</p>
			<p>"Can anyone here explain to me what's going on?"</p>
			<p>Calennius rises from their seat, an almost amused expression on their face. "First time?"</p>
			<p>"First time in this room? Yes. What stabilizing measure was used that you can hold a <i>space-dilated room</i> sustained?"</p>
			<p>Calennius makes their way towards the newcomer, their eyes flashing as they walk. They abruptly stop. "I wouldn't say truly dilated. If I speak correctly, more so 'molded Conceptually and then converted into matter within a pseudo-metaphysical demiplane,' but your definition is close enough."</p>
			<p>They study him inquisitively. "But enough of that. Who may you be?"</p>
			<p>Upon hearing "<i>demiplane</i>," the youth relaxes visibly.</p>
			<p>"That... would explain it, then. Call me Permafrost. I'm from Daerd's north border."</p>
			<p>They consider for a moment.</p>
			<p>"Although," he adds, "you probably don't know what that means. It should suffice to say that magic works... extra uniquely in Daerd. Please, forgive my misunderstanding."</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Calennius</h3>
			<p>If Calennius is surprised, they don't show it. They seem to contemplate the statement briefly before finally speaking.</p>
			<p>"There are many worlds in the Plane - and I must admit, I have not seen them all even in my time. Let us hope yours is shielded similarly from less benevolent gazes."</p>
			<p>Permafrost frowns and walks to the barkeeps, looking at the many bottles adorning the counter. His eyes run up and down the rows before finally falling upon one in particular, causing him to smile to himself in response.</p>
			<p>"So this place... is a sort of bar? How interesting." He addresses the automaton manning it with a wave. "Perhaps I might stay here for a while, then. How much for a glass of Solmark '78?"</p>
			<p>The barkeep gives him a glass of a red, carbonated drink and whirs rhythmically for a short time. Permafrost nods and begins to drink, then turns back to Calennius.</p>
			<p>"I believe I have a trinket to give you. I was asked to give this to someone from another world; I don't think this is what was intended, but it works."</p>
			<p>He holds out a small mechanical spider, which whirs to life in his palm. Its eyes glow a vivid orange as it clambers up his arm, supported by pairs of tiny needle-like copper legs.</p>
			<p>Calennius plucks it away gently and holds the artifact up towards them."Truly quite an interesting creation," they say as it extends elegant mechanical limbs. "It seems I have underestimated the capabilities of your home - a rare compliment."</p>
			<p>"But," Calennius intercuts, "Perhaps such a thing is better off in different hands."</p>
			<p>They hand it back. "Mine are far too battered and broken for such a thing, and in more ways than one."</p>
			<p>Permafrost makes a fairly long series of clicks and hums, and the spider turns off. He puts it back in one of his pockets, and smiles.</p>
			<p>"It is not hard to underestimate our technology in Daerd. Even if, perhaps, it has downsides."</p>
			<p>Permafrost looks down for a moment, eyes suddenly downcast. Memories, dark and drifting, briefly make their way across his gaze.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>The Hunter</h3>
			<p>Only one way out.</p>
			<p>Aurelion watches as the last of the stalkers vanishes into the undergrowth, scuttling into the violet shrubbery. For a moment, it turns and hisses, lashing its whip-like, segmented tail a final time before joining the rest of its pack in the distance.</p>
			<p>Aurelion slashes his sword through the air and growls in return, edging forwards in a defensive stance. He stands there for a minute more, tensing in preparation.</p>
			<p>Finally, it seems that the creatures are gone. The soldier breathes in relief and wipes the beasts' turquoise blood from the blade with his cloak, which briefly fizzes and crackles in reaction to the substance.</p>
			<p>The stalkers had constantly pursued him for the last two days, relentlessly following him through the azure jungle. He had slept, with his sword in hand, on a tree, only half-awake as he listened to the damnable things loping below.</p>
			<p>According to the map he had found, carried by the man in the red robes, the settlement ahead was only two more miles away. He knew it was so close - and yet, in the jungle, such distances seemed eons away.</p>
			<p>He missed civilization - missed the familiar sights and sounds of the Capitol's streets, missed the olive groves of the Darax manor - even that strange bar and its even stranger inhabitants. He craved company, even if it was the tiefling Neshu; or whatever they truly were.</p>
			<p>But yet, here he was. Miles away from their camp, an immeasurable distance away from civilization, trapped in the jungles of Hell itself.</p>
			<p>Aurelion sighs. There was no time to even reminisce - he had to get to the settlement, at all costs possible.</p>
			<p>The forests are silent as he makes his way forwards, ever wary of his surroundings. It's a rare occasion - silence in the azure forest only means two things: either that the jungle fears him, or that it's terrified of something else entirely. He'd rather not consider the second possibility.</p>
			<p>A sudden rumbling abruptly echoes through the grove and Aurelion immediately ducks into the undergrowth, clutching the hilt of his sword with sweaty hands. Buried in the plants, he warily scans his surroundings, trying to detect movement.</p>
			<p>What was it? A glider, searching the canopy for prey? Or worse, one of the crawling shadows, with fangs as long and sharp as knives?</p>
			<p>He knows he can't do much against either. His quiver is almost depleted, and his sword will barely make a dent against a shadow's muscled hide.</p>
			<p>The rumbling grows louder and Aurelion turns his head slightly, rolling onto his back. Rather than the periodic beat of wingbeats, it's a loud, steady hum, almost like an insect's buzzings amplified to a resounding degree. What sort of monstrous thing, he wonders, could make a noise like that?</p>
			<p>Before he can react, the answer suddenly crests the clearing above him with a gust of wind. Aurelion gazes upwards in sheer shock, frozen in utter horror.</p>
			<p>The creature is a colossal, cylindrical thing made of almost-metal-like hide. It bears a thin, stiff tail and three rapidly spinning wings atop its body, which seemingly are the source of the hum.</p>
			<p>It has two pairs of translucent, vaguely rectangular eyes alongside its body, with one more on its head. The eyes occasionally flash with bright light, casting a sharp, bright glow on the forest below.</p>
			<p>And on its side, painted in bright red, is a familiar symbol - two concentric circles crossed by a waving line.</p>
			<p>With a start, Aurelion realizes that it isn't a beast at all; it's a machine, some sort of monstrous flying device made out of molded metal plate. The "eyes" are glass, windows to the vessel's interior - and the tail is some sort of stabilizer.</p>
			<p>As the creation vanishes into the distance, carried upon its metal wings, Aurelion is left, his mouth agape, in the windblown shrubbery. He'd never seen anything like it before - what sort of men, if they were men at all, flew in ships forged from steel?</p>
			<p>He supposed the only answers he could find lay ahead.</p>
			<p>After all, there was only one way out.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Permafrost</h3>
			<p><i>Winter ran clumsily from the drones behind him.</i></p>
			<p><i>"Help! Help!"</i></p>
			<p><i>Nobody offered a hand or a gun. Not even a Battery or an encouraging word. Nobody wanted to cross Kinaeon, the Highreign AI that had taken over the area. Rebel estimates of its forces numbered three hundred drones, a hundred twenty warbots, and twenty model C-12 Emergents. A huge force for only a tenth of a Shard.</i></p>
			<p><i>Winter pulled out the last thing in his pocket - a single piece of copper wire. Without Kinaeon, he would've been the son of a lord! He would've had at least four Batteries on him at all times.</i></p>
			<p><i>He threw the wire, pushing as much Flux as he could into it. Propelled by chaos, the wire flew ten times harder than it should've and blew up the drone when it got close. Entirely luck, but it worked, destroying two of the three drones following him. He threw a rock at the last one, which bounced off uselessly, but it did fly away.</i></p>
			<p><i>But no. Those days were over. He was back to a noble position - the same as before Kinaeon - and he'd bothered to become much more experienced since then.</i></p>
			<p>Permafrost looks back up.</p>
			<p>"Well, I shouldn't be bothering you with any of that. I can understand not wanting to damage something expensive to produce. Even if there are costlier things out there, that's no reason not to take care of it. I suppose I'll hide from my stress a little longer, then I ought to be on my way."</p>
			<p>Permafrost finishes his drink before once more glancing furtively at the room around him.</p>
			<p>"...Perhaps I underestimated the strangeness of the folks around here."</p>
			<p>He cocks his head, looking at Low. "Has he been muttering to himself the whole time he's been here?"</p>
			<p>"No," responds Calennius. Their eyes flash, changing rapidly from blue to gold to black. "I believe he's having an episode of some sort."</p>
			<p>Permafrost sets his gaze towards Low and ponders for a few moments - drifting then to Eoc, who stands in silent concentration nearby.</p>
			<p>"You intend to heal him?" the youth asks. Eoc nods, still deep in thought. "If it's possible at all. His insanity is deep, newcomer."</p>
			<p>Permafrost glances at the elf a final time, biting his lip, and turns to the automaton bartender.</p>
			<p>"<span class="loh">Concentration</span>, please," he asks. The word comes out warbled, as if a combination of two completely different sounds barely sounding recognizable.</p>
			<p>The automaton whirs for a moment, causing Permafrost to make another whirring sound in response. The automaton begins preparing a drink of some sort. Permafrost whirs to another one, who procures another carbonated drink - blue this time.</p>
			<p>"Unfortunately, I've spent most of the, ah, <i>power</i> I brought with me," he says, addressing the tiefling. I have a solution for him, but it will be short-lived. While we wait for it to be prepared, perhaps we might discuss other matters?"</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Enderae</h3>
			<p>Hearing a fragment of conversation in the back of the bar, Enderae rises from his seat, turning to where Calennius sits with a now-dispersing crowd gathered around them. He looks to Endistic, who hesitantly nods in reply.</p>
			<p>"Do you think they're the contact?" his friend asks, gaze evidently fixed on Calennius as well.</p>
			<p>"They have to be," Enderae answers. "They've drawn quite a commotion, haven't they?"</p>
			<p>Endistic still seems troubled as he regards the planeshifter from a distance. "Are you sure you want to do this? What if Xaithos is playing us all for fools?"</p>
			<p>Enderae grimaces. "Xaithos has always schemed.</p>
			<p>But this - this seems <i>true</i>. Simply imagine what we could do if we succeed, with one of the Emperor's own artifacts in our hands. We could quell the Zainemian uprising. We could go home."</p>
			<p>"I don't trust them," the other Enderian observes from nearby. "Any of them - not Xaithos and definitely not this one. Look at the badge on their chest - they know too much, Rae. <i>Far</i> too much."</p>
			<p>"Then maybe they know about the artifact." Enderae breathes in and strides for the table. "Come on."</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Calennius smiles and looks up as the two Enderians appear, eyes sparkling. The corner they sit in is now empty, which Enderae breathes in relief to before sitting down.</p>
			<p>"At last," the human says briskly.  "Should I question why Xaithos did not show up himself?"</p>
			<p>"He sent us in his stead," Enderae responds, the statement only partially a lie. "We are... more suited for the task at the moment."</p>
			<p>"It's quite strange of him to use a Clanmaster of the Void and the crown prince of Enderia itself for the task, don't you think?" Calennius remarks.</p>
			<p>"But worry not," they add upon seeing Endistic's expression tense in response. "I don't deal in your local politics. In fact, I tend to stay away from your world in general."</p>
			<p>From nearby, Endistic speaks. "I assume you know what we seek?"</p>
			<p>The human nods in response. "Plenty and more, my friend."</p>
			<p>Enderae looks around again before speaking in a lower voice. "What would you have us exchange? We have plenty of gold, if you're willing to take foreign currency."</p>
			<p>Calennius' eyes flash, their hues now a deep scarlet.  "I need none of it."</p>
			<p>Their hands tap against the table's surface, a soft and rhythmic beat. "In the words of the Enderian philosopher Shaitar, "knowledge-"</p>
			<p>"-is the most precious of all," Endistic finishes with a frown. "Do you want information?"</p>
			<p>"Not exactly," they answer with another knowing smile, causing a chill to run up Enderae's back in response.</p>
			<p>"To know what you desire, simply tell me a story."</p>
			<p>His friend glances at Enderae with distrust in his eyes. Enderae narrows his eyes as well and ponders for several prolonged moments before nodding. "...What do you want?"</p>
			<p>"I believe you know this tale well," Calennius says. "Tell me of Xyraith."</p>

			<h3>Eoc</h3>
			<p>Eoc watches Permafrost intently as he prepares the concoction, a miniature storm of energy flying around him and coursing up his gloved hands. The magic crackles and sparks before it flies into a glass cup procured by the automaton.</p>
			<p>Moments later, Permafrost returns with a single orange pill, one that emits a strange, almost comforting warmth as he hands it to him.</p>
			<p>"This should suffice," he says. "Do not waste it - such ingredients are quite rare outside of this… place."</p>
			<p>Eoc nods. "May Thalaik bless you for your help, outsider. You have my greatest thanks."</p>
			<p>Permafrost nods lightly in reply and Eoc breathes in tense anticipation before striding towards Low, who sits in a corner of the bar with eyes glazed and unfocused.</p>
			<p>"I await answers, elf," he says, holding it out. "Do not disappoint."</p>
			<p>Suddenly, in a rapid burst of almost inhuman speed, Low jolts from his seat, taking the pill from Eoc's hand and swallowing it immediately. The man stumbles back as shadows dance across his vision - then close in, turning the bar dark.</p>
			<p>"What do you seek, Frostbearer?"</p>
			<p>The shadows shift in front of him and Low appears, cloak rippling as he stands with back turned to him. Involuntarily, a dagger of ice forms in Eoc's palm - then somehow shatters, torn into shreds, when Low waves his hand carelessly moments later.</p>
			<p>"Where am I?" Eoc asks, panic rising instinctively in his chest. "What have you done to me?"</p>
			<p>"I mean no harm," the elf says, eyes scanning his surroundings. "And I'm afraid there's little time left to speak." He glances around himself quickly, watching the shadows as if for signs of movement in the dark.</p>
			<p>"So, tell me, what is it?" Low braces and holds his head for a moment.</p>
			<p>"And how do you know things that cause themselves to become obscure?"</p>
			<p>"When you study under Thalaik himself, you learn to pick up on the little things."</p>
			<p>Eoc looks Low in the eyes, gaze cold.</p>
			<p>"But that is not important. Why have your men been attacking Hernandese shrines? And what has caused you to enter this... state of insanity?"</p>
			<p>"Hernan?" Low asks, still unfocused. "Sevrien... looking for something, then? Should've been in the Eye."</p>
			<p>"Sevrien? Does he not serve you? And besides, most shrines take up an oath of poverty."</p>
			<p>A tiny bumblebee made of ice materializes in the air beside him and alights on his shoulder, causing him to momentarily unfocus. "Hmmm? Oh..."</p>
			<p>Low seems ever more unstable by the second. "No. Sevrien. Wants... artifact? Maybe?"</p>
			<p>The elf shudders and breathes deeply, falling silent.</p>
			<p>Eoc is visibly confused. "You are telling me that you have been... usurped by Sevrien?" As he speaks, the bumblebee shatters into shards of ice, floating aimlessly in the air.</p>
			<p>"Not exactly." He pauses once more, his eyes widening as he stares into the darkness. Eoc feels a chill run across his back - the shadows have seemingly advanced a few feet inwards towards them.</p>
			<p>"Death. Why do I hear it?"</p>
			<p>His voice clears once more - though a hint of uneasiness still pervades his tone. "Frostbringer. You caused the death of a dragon I had known for fifty years. I do not forgive you. I would kill you now, but you have aided me, and the aura of Fate lingers here. You have brought me troubling news, and I will condemn Sevrien if I can."</p>
			<p>Eoc stands to face him, pulling out a coin from his pocket.</p>
			<p>"Your dragon is nowhere near dead. Calling it so would be an insult to its core. Perhaps you should seek out Cryst, my dear sister. Stay away from the shrines and we will do the same. Farewell." Eoc then flicks the coin to Low, who catches it with a swift outstretched hand.</p>
			<p>"The same to you, then," he responds. "I will keep your words at heart. Now..."</p>
			<p>The darkness shifts a final time and Low closes his eyes. "It's best if you leave. They don't like others sharing my mind for too long."</p>
			<p>Before Eoc can speak again, the darkness suddenly shoots forwards and engulfs the elf, expanding rapidly to swallow the room in shades of ever-darkening black. Before the shadowy tendrils can reach him, a <b>force</b> pulls him away, setting his mind to blackness.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Endistic</h3>
			<p>All Enderians know of the story of Xyraith. Our first and our last emperor, who both rose highest and fell farthest of all."</p>
			<p>Calennius nods. "Xyraith was many things," they say. "Dragon. King. God."</p>
			<p>Surprised, Endistic cuts off and glances towards them. The informant's eyes flash violet before they wave for him to continue.</p>
			<p>"Then, all Enderians viewed the dragons as gods - not just the Voidling Draconic cults. But instead of deities that intervened - they were distant, celestial beings, guardians from afar.</p>
			<p>Until Xyraith."</p>
			<p>"Xyraith was young," Calennius intercuts. "As many are, driven by ambition most of all. He pursued the now long-since-forgotten tale of a power beneath Enderia, a divine well once harnessed by the Ancients themselves to reshape the world. The souls of two gods."</p>
			<p>"The End and the Void," Enderae adds. "The deities that created us."</p>
			<p>"Perhaps," Calennius says slowly, voice barely audible. "Better known as Entropy and Antithesis instead."</p>
			<p>Endistic blinks and then finally continues. "Many thought Xyraith mad, the way he spent years upon years in search. It was a fool's endeavor, truly - and such things were more myth than reality. They assumed Xyraith to merely be a feverous zealot - until he returned, transformed completely, to the capital of Eaon decades later and declared himself emperor. Declared himself a god."</p>
			<p>"And most astonishing of all, it was true. Much had changed about Xyraith." the human agrees. "He had grown taller, stronger, his eyes aglow with red and black light instead of the natural violet. His scales possessed an almost luminous quality - as if frozen in time, undying. All could clearly see what he had become - and yet, those were not his most defining qualities.</p>
			<p>Spoken of most of all, of course, were the two things he carried with him."</p>
			<p>Endistic nods. "The Divine Artifacts. A crown of gold with a single red gem that made its wearer impervious to all harm; and a sword, its blade blacker than the darkest night in the void, that could destroy anything with a single touch."</p>
			<p>Calennius' eyes flicker.</p>
			<p>"Xyraith had not become a god," they say with another smile.  "No; he had captured them instead."</p>
			<p>"You know what happens next," follows Endistic. "Xyraith conquered the End - united it under his banner. He forced the masters of the Great Clans to swear allegiance to him - and then ushered in a new age of technological advancement as we began to explore the Plane beyond."</p>
			<p>Calennius seems solemn as they speak. "A new age, truly." They balance the words carefully.</p>
			<p>"Yet one paid for in blood.</p>
			<p>It is said that following his conquest, Xyraith began to act erratically. He ranted of the glories of battle, of killing and conquest. He began speaking of a war for control even greater than the one before - domination of the Greater Plane itself. Whether it was simply bloodlust or as some claim, a more arcane factor, caused by the two Artifacts he now kept so zealously to himself, it was clear that the Emperor had become mad.</p>
			<p>And thus, not all were happy with the new order - it is only natural that opposition rises against tyranny. But few wanted to challenge Xyraith's power... until..."</p>
			<p>"An assassin," Enderae whispers.</p>
			<p>"A man," Calennius slowly corrects. "One who believed such power should not be held so easily. They bided their time, waiting and planning, preparing for the day when..."</p>
			<p>"They stole the Artifacts and killed Xyraith," Endistic finishes. "Plunged Enderia into civil war, caused the death of the Clanmaster Zainem and allowed the usurper Lakotas to rise to power. Whatever they wanted, it failed."</p>
			<p>"And so we sit here now," Calennius remarks with a smile. "Seeking artifacts hundreds of years lost to time, to take Xyraith's mantle and unite Enderia in his fashion. Ambitious as the emperor himself, wouldn't you think? And as I'm sure, ready to pay a price equally as great for it."</p>
			<p>Enderae's eyes are cold. "We told you what you want," the other Enderian replies, tone edged with forcefulness as his hand drifts to the hilt of his katana. "So what information do you have?"</p>
			<p>"It will come. But for now, permit me to tell you one thing more."</p>
			<p>"And what is that?" Enderae questions.</p>
			<p>Calennius' eyes sparkle with light. "How this story ends."</p>
			<p>"The assassin fled far from Enderia afterwards, taking the Artifacts with them. Though they first reveled in the power that they had obtained - they quickly began to realize the price that Xyraith had paid.</p>
			<p>It was true - the Artifacts were no mere objects. They whispered, making their bearers drunk on their power, enflaming their desire for more. If they gave in, the assassin knew, they would merely be a tool to the very relics that they wielded.</p>
			<p> For such malevolent gods, you see, are not so easily locked away.</p>
			<p>The assassin knew then that what they held could not stray into the hands of others again - and so, they came to a resolution. They hid them - far away from all who could hope to find them, in a place so remote and far away that even they forgot of its whereabouts themselves."</p>
			<p>Calennius clasps their hands together. "The assassin's tale was passed across the spans of time, ultimately lasting far longer than even they themselves could have hoped to do. Fact became myth and myth became fable, and such is the fate of this story now. A word to the wise, if you will. A warning against the reckless pursuit of power.</p>
			<p>That is what I know, my Enderian friends.</p>
			<p>I only hope you will act with wisdom now."</p>
			<p>Enderae's eyes burn with rage and he suddenly stands up, drawing his katana in a sudden flash of steel. The blade's runes crackle with waves of brilliant energy, coursing up and down its surface. Calennius, however, is completely unperturbed, their expression calm as ever before as they sit in place.</p>
			<p>"A story? Is that all you have to give us?" Enderae asks, his patience completely lost. "You led us all the way here to be tricked?"</p>
			<p>"It is not a trick," Calennius responds. "It is a lesson."</p>
			<p>Enderae breathes heavily as the planeshifter, still unflinching, stands up and walks in the direction of the bar. His eyes are alight with an uncontrollable fury, one that makes even Endistic flinch in nervousness as it turns towards him.</p>
			<p>"We were fools to come here," he says. "How could we have even hoped to do this, wishing for some <i>artifact</i> to save us from our troubles? The Zainemians are everywhere, and the Clanmasters fight even now. Xaithos..."</p>
			<p>"Rae?"</p>
			<p>His friend turns in his direction, his voice soft and conciliatory.</p>
			<p>"There's still hope."</p>
			<p>Enderae frowns in response.</p>
			<p>"Why do we need the Artifacts?" Endistic continues. "Do you remember how we fought Lakotas' regime?</p>
			<p>What good do we do cowering, dealing with the likes of Xaithos and Thaivarr for survival? Enderia is broken. They need us; need change, before it reaches a point even we can't control. It's time to go home, Rae, whether we have a god behind us or not."</p>
			<p>Enderae sighs, closing his eyes wistfully as the anger begins to drain away.</p>
			<p>"Home. Perhaps it is at last."</p>

			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: The Plane of Concept</h3>
			<p>The Greater Plane is effectively made from two overlapping dimensional layers - Physicality and Concept. Concept is an inaccessible, incomprehensible realm made of ideas and commands, where the fabric of reality is designed. It is a realm that lies beneath all there is - thousands of tiny interlocking pieces that when run under a collective, unifying command, are able to create something far greater.</p>
			<p>Physicality is the manifestation of Concept - it's where elements such as spatiality and antimatter manifest in material form. Physicality is the world that mortals know and live in, a realm of matter formed from Conceptual commands. However, the Greater Plane is not entirely perfect. Due to the actions of planeshifters, who exploited small flaws in its fabric, Concept has begun to leak into Physicality in the form of Aspect Wells, fundamental elements of the material world manifest in the form of raw power.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Permafrost</h3>
			<p>Light blossoms in the room around Eoc as he slowly wakes, lifting himself from the floor groggily. Permafrost stands nearby, his brow furrowed as the youth addresses him. "You were passed out for a few minutes there. Did you learn what you wished of him?"</p>
			<p>"To a degree," Eoc responds. "Supposedly, someone other than him ordered... well, the order that I was mad at him for."</p>
			<p>The elf continues muttering to themselves. Something about death. Permafrost, meanwhile, takes a long pause. "Someone got killed, didn't they?"</p>
			<p>It's Eoc's turn to pause this time. "Many people."</p>
			<p>Permafrost says nothing, and takes a long drink of blue soda. A quadrupedal drone wanders from Permafrost's sleeve and begins dancing on the counter. Permafrost makes a whirring sound, and it stops, then crawls back into his sleeve.</p>
			<p>Permafrost takes a ring from his finger, and places it in front of Eoc before walking off and ordering a small cup of water. "A gift. It is rare for my people to interact with the outside, and I believe you are a worthy recipient. Now, I shall be taking my leave soon."</p>
			<p>Eoc picks up the ring tentatively. The image of a billowing snowstorm is reflected in the gem atop it, swirling and dancing as if captured within. He stares, gaze fixed in its depths, as he muses over the past events.</p>
			<p><i>My world has changed forever.</i></p>
			<p><i>Yet it has not ended.</i></p>
			<p>Eoc turns toward Permafrost. "Wait. Is there a way I could speak to them for any longer? Perhaps a further dose?"</p>
			<p>The youth bites his lip in response. "I... fear there's little I can do, without a Daerdian catalyst. Perhaps if I could return... and even then, such things would be difficult to obtain."</p>
			<p>"There is a different way."</p>
			<p>Calennius' soft voice breaks the silence, leaving faint echoes in its wake.</p>
			<p>They step away from the counter, eyes glittering as they begin to speak. Both gazes swivel in the direction of the planeshifter, whose angular features have an intensity to them.</p>
			<p>"It is a difficult process, I will admit. But if done right, it can even permanently absolve one of their afflictions."</p>
			<p>"Tell me," the man says, grimacing. "I do not fear difficulty."</p>
			<p>"A Spiritual connection must be established for such a process to begin - their wards block all binding magic cast upon them. Unfortunately, however, I fear it is beyond your capabilities to create one."</p>
			<p>"Then how?" Eoc asks, eyes narrowing.</p>
			<p>"In truth, there's no need to create one anew," Calennius says, the faintest hint of a smile upon their face.</p>
			<p>"There is one in this very room that has such a thing already made - the only question is whether or not she will agree to what you propose."</p>
			<p>A heavy silence falls before a distant scraping echoes from one corner of the room and a shadow looms over all three of them.</p>
			<p>"I do," Thedra says, nodding resolutely towards him.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>The Hunted</h3>
			<p>Augusta waited to die.</p>
			<p>Reaching to her right, she picked up the pen nearby and dipped it in a jar of ink. Slowly and carefully, she began to write.</p>
			<p><i>I am sorry.</i></p>
			<p><i>If you ever read this, I will be dead.</i></p>
			<p><i>Do not worry for me. I only did what had to be done - gave you the chance you've been waiting for all this time.</i></p>
			<p><i>I expect you will already know the truth. This world is a crumbling one, and the Empire is a lie. We are pawns, manipulated from the stars, wholly under the palm of these cultists of their Sovereign.</i></p>
			<p>Footsteps echoed in the hallway behind her, and she quickened, stashing away the conical metal device she held, its surface slashed by a crimson symbol, with her other hand.</p>
			<p><i>I have no power to stop it, in truth. But yours is a different matter entirely.</i></p>
			<p><i>The device you were given, as you probably now know, was never intended to send you to the location it was meant to. You were sent to a remote place far from their grasp - where you would in turn be intercepted by a certain... ally.</i></p>
			<p><i>If you read this, I am sure you will have found them - know they speak the truth if they carry a winged shield with them.</i></p>
			<p><i>A final word of advice.</i></p>
			<p><i>If you ever come back, stay away from all of this. You have much greater pursuits to follow - and I trust you to do so.</i></p>
			<p><i>I love you, as I always have,</i></p>
			<p><i>Augusta.</i></p>
			<p>Then the door burst open in a spray of wooden scraps and a Praetorian entered the room.</p>
			<p>Augusta backed away as the creature approached, looming eight feet tall above her.</p>
			<p>Humanoid in shape, with skin an unnatural shade of metallic gray, the monster was clad in burnished gold armor, a scarlet cape with the Imperial dragon fluttering in the air upon its back. Its two red eyes, glowing like hot coals, stared her down as it approached with three guardsmen, dwarfed in comparison, following in its wake.</p>
			<p>Though it bore no visible weapons, the Legate felt the cold chill of fear run through her veins all the same. It was commonly known that a Praetorian unarmed was a terrible sign - it was confident that it couldn't be beaten.</p>
			<p>The Praetorian slams its fists onto the table, causing it to suddenly split in two. Ink spills all over the ground as the Praetorian raises the table over its head and effortlessly tosses it towards the window, smashing the glass as it soars out of view. The planar focus drops to the ground and the Praetorian picks it up, tightening their grip and crushing it to bits moments afterwards.</p>
			<p>Augusta, still holding the pen in her hand, stumbles in the window's direction, looking for a way - <i>any way</i> to defend herself.</p>
			<p>The Praetorian begins to speak, revealing a gray-lipped mouth lined with rows of eerily white teeth. Its words resounds, echoing with many voices at once - young and old, female and male, strong and feeble.</p>
			<p>"Consul Vaexattor has called for your removal. Resistance is futile."</p>
			<p>Augusta scrambles away - but stops when the Praetorian <i>leaps</i> forwards, moving to block her. Lifting her with a single gray hand, it takes ahold of her by her throat and drags her towards the shattered window. With its other hand, it takes her letter and crumples it, dropping it on the floor and crushing it to bits with the heel of its boot.</p>
			<p>A tear runs down Augusta's cheek as the creature lifts her high above the city below, dangling from its cold gray hands.</p>
			<p>"You did not outsmart the Consul," it says in its horrifying echoing voice. "It is over now."</p>
			<p>Augusta bows her head numbly, feeling the Praetorian's grip loosen. She only had a few moments more now.</p>
			<p>"It is truly unfortunate that another focus was lost," it says in an almost gloating tone. "But it is only a natural price for the elimination of such an insurgent."</p>
			<p>Suddenly, Augusta moves, a burst of speed and power birthed from sheer desperation. With her free hand, she throws the pen - but misses the Praetorian. Instead, it embeds itself in the bookshelf opposite her - where it now begins to emanate a soft red glow.</p>
			<p>The Praetorian stares in shock, unmoving entirely.</p>
			<p>Its lips only have time to utter a single word. "How?"</p>
			<p>Then, the pen, book, and the true letter within all disappear in a bright flash of scarlet light, vanishing into a rift displaying a foreign sky far beyond.</p>
			<p>Augusta smiles at the monster as it crushes her in its grasp, victorious despite the immense pain. The black-haired stranger with the compass she had met three days ago truly had been proven right in the end.</p>
			<p>The Praetorian howls and lets go, dropping Augusta into the streets of the Capitol. Even as the floor hurtles up to meet her, she smiles on, relishing the fury of the creature high above.</p>
			<p>She had not failed him in the end.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: Aspect Wells</h3>
			<p>As the fabric of the Greater Plane stretched thinner and yet thinner, gaps in Physicality began to form. These flaws in the Plane allowed exploiters to travel instantaneously between points on the Plane, a technique known as Planeshifting. However, unbeknownst to the planeshifters, the practice had an unforeseen drawback. It tore holes in reality, causing elements of Concept to leak into the mortal world. These bores in reality became known as Aspect Wells, where Aspects of Concept such as entropy, heat, and motion take physical form. Aspect Wells can be drawn upon by willing hosts, giving their bearers great power in exchange for consuming part of their identity and replacing it with their own will.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Low</h3>
			<p>Thedra steps slowly towards Low, her footfalls resounding against the floor.</p>
			<p>"Now, now, Low - it was Low, right? That's what you're calling yourself these days? <u>Regardless</u>, what <u>are</u> you talking about?"</p>
			<p>She waits for several moments, during which Low does nothing but stare at her silently, his mutterings having ceased for a time.</p>
			<p>Thedra's smile slowly began working itself into a grimace, features distorted and exacerbated by the inhuman mask.</p>
			<p>"Let's extract ourselves from these... prying eyes," Thedra growls, gesturing to the several people with nothing better to do than watch the interaction with one of her metallic claws.</p>
			<p>Arms began wrenching themselves from the ground - arms of shadow and vine in equal parts, thorns of shadow and walls of leaves. They show no regard for the placement of tables and chairs, wrenching them into a dozen pieces, carving their way through the hapless wood. They grow up surrounding Thedra and Low, until a cocoon of poisoned branches and inscrutable darkness encloses the two.</p>
			<p>"Alrighty, drop the act. You're too cynical to go insane. Talk to me. What's wrong?"</p>
			<p>Low twitches rather violently, as though attempting to rearrange his body.</p>
			<p><b>"<i>You</i>... and the, in my mind, c-can't."</b></p>
			<p>Thedra stands there for a moment, as though contemplating.</p>
			<p>With a violent speed, in a motion so sudden as to cause Low to flinch with such vigour that he collapses, Thedra throws her entire body to one side and lashes out with one of her mechanical arms at half of a table, unfortunate once in its dissection by the dark wall, and now unfortunate twice by its being the subject of Thedra's wrath. The table is crushed into a thousand pieces, and the arm continues, tearing a sizable hole through the floor.</p>
			<p><b>"GOD... DAMN... IT!"</b></p>
			<p>"YOU WERE THE <b>ONE</b> PERSON I COULD TRUST TO BE SANE IN THIS WRETCHED PLANE!"</p>
			<p>The roar of Thedra's voice reaches even the outside world.</p>
			<p>Low, cowering in a corner, has his hands clamped firmly over his ears.</p>
			<p><b>"please... please make it stop, it's too much please i cant stOP STOP THE VOICES-"</b></p>
			<p>Thedra walks over to Low, slowly. Low begins trembling.</p>
			<p><i>"Get up."</i></p>
			<p>Low scrambles to his feet, legs quivering below him. Thedra's face returns to the too-broad smile.</p>
			<p>"See? That wasn't so hard! All it takes is a little <i>convincing</i> to return your wits! Now, let's get out of this wretched place."</p>
			<p>Low began shaking his head, at increasingly rapid rates.</p>
			<p><b>"i can still hear them why can i still hear them they won't go away please <span style="color:darkred;">kill</span> them please-"</b></p>
			<p><i>"Shut the <b>hell</b> up."</i></p>
			<p>Low shrunk back into the shadows, seemingly attempting to escape Thedra. Thedra then shook her head, as though dispelling some trance that had befell her.</p>
			<p>"Look, maybe I'm being a little unreasonable here. Let's just... just forget all that, alright? I'm just... I care about you, okay? I can't bear to see you like... like this."</p>
			<p>Low began to emerge timidly from his cloak of shadows and vines.</p>
			<p>"Good! Now, let's get you out of here, and get you right fixed up, m'kay? I know a guy who can probably fix whatever you have going on."</p>
			<p>Low began shaking his head once more.</p>
			<p><b>"they'll get me if i go out there they know where i am they're looking for me i have to stay i can't leave-"</b></p>
			<p>"Now, now, let's not be <i>unreasonable</i>. Getting out of this rancid tavern would be best for you, certainly. Nobody's hunting you."</p>
			<p><b>"<i>they</i> are. i can't... the Realm, and we tried-"</b></p>
			<p>Thedra paused, waiting for more. Nothing came.</p>
			<p>"You're goddamn hopeless, that's what you are."</p>
			<p>The walls forced themselves back into the ground, and the tables and chairs reassembled themselves. Notably, the particular table Thedra had smashed remained as such, and the hole in the ground didn't go away.</p>
			<p>Thedra turned away from Low, an air of disgust surrounding her.</p>
			<p>"Look how the mighty have fallen."</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Thedra</h3>
			<p>Shadows shift in the corner of the bar, and Thedra suddenly appears before Calennius, looming with arms outstretched. Their voice is deathly quiet as she speaks, eyes fixated on the one before her.</p>
			<p>"Who <i>are</i> you?</p>
			<p>And <i>how the hell did you know?</i>"</p>
			<p>Calennius sits unmoving, barely even flinching as they raise their head with eyes closed.</p>
			<p>"Who do you think I am?"</p>
			<p>Calennius snaps open their eyes, revealing a myriad of shifting colors, each bursting with shimmering waves of light. In their eyes run spans of eons, creation and destruction, birth and death, growth and decay. In those, for half a moment, Thedra sees something similar to <i>herself</i> - something primordial, and not entirely human.</p>
			<p>And for a moment, the bar is completely silent. The bargoers stop, automatons whir to a halt, and talking fades away. Calennius smiles - and Thedra quiets as well, frozen in place.</p>
			<p>"You're it, aren't you?" Thedra asks slowly.</p>
			<p>"The bar itself?"</p>
			<p>"No," Calennius replies with an almost kindly smile. "I am merely the innkeeper.</p>
			<p>I know your friend," they say, waving in Low's direction, "for an entirely different reason."</p>
			<p>Thedra seems to regain her composure as she looms over Calennius again. "Did you do this to him? <i>Tell me.</i>"</p>
			<p>Calennius laughs. "Why would I? No - unfortunately, their situation is one they brought upon themselves."</p>
			<p>"And how can I trust you?" she whispers.</p>
			<p>Calennius continues to laugh at that, eyes sparkling as they address her.</p>
			<p>"Your suspicions are right. You can't."</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Luthan</h3>
			<p>As Thedra withdraws, Luthan steps forwards in turn, tentatively surveying the room.</p>
			<p>So much had happened in the last few minutes - he can almost feel the webs of layered schemes and ambitions and rivalries that now seemed to cover the tiny bar in coatings of tensely wound threads. Every bargoer seemingly had a different set of inscrutable motives - the Enderians hunting for a precious artifact, Eoc attempting to bring Low to justice, Thedra seeking the elf as well - and of course, Calennius at the center of it all. The planeshifter was no cultist, it was clear - in truth, it was as if he seemingly knew less about them every new word they spoke.</p>
			<p><i>So many possibilities.</i> Calennius was dangerous, he was sure of it - but perhaps, could they become an ally as well? He needed plenty of them for certain, having almost certainly attracted both the Cult and the Warden's attentions - and Calennius... knew. Judging from their telling of the last story, they could even be considered the most valuable source of information in the very bar itself.</p>
			<p>As if in response to his thoughts, Calennius turns from their seat to address him.</p>
			<p>"Please, sit down," they say. "Our conversation is not finished just yet."</p>
			<p>Luthan hesitates before doing so, taking a seat complacently. In response, other planeshifter smiles in response.</p>
			<p>"To answer your last question - I assume you've realized that this disguise is feigned," they begin.</p>
			<p>"I find it truly unfortunate that such allegiances are now considered normality amongst our profession. How low we have fallen, truly, for neutrality and the pursuit of peace to be condemned."</p>
			<p>Seeing the look in his eyes, they nod and continue.</p>
			<p>"And I imagine now that you wonder where I stand. Well, my friend, I shall state it simply.</p>
			<p>Though we may not live to become allies in truth, it seems our motives align for the task at hand. You seek to stop those who worship the Sovereign - and I... endeavor to ensure what they seek cannot be obtained."</p>
			<p>Luthan's eyes widen in realization. "So it's true, then. That's what this has all been about - Xyraith, Irivex. The gods.</p>
			<p>The Plane Between is fraying, and you intend to mend it."</p>
			<p>Calennius' eyes, a deep azure, are solemn as they reply.</p>
			<p>"The Plane of Concept, to be exact. Weakened by our very own doings and then torn by the worst of us.  It was never the power that they sought to harness, malevolent and destructive as it may be, that led to this downfall now. No. It was ultimately our very own selves."</p>
			<p>A chill runs its way up Luthan's back. "And what now? Are we consigned to this fate?"</p>
			<p>"Our paths are different ones entirely. On your own road, it is up to you to decide," they answer. "All I have for you is a gift."</p>
			<p>They reach into the pockets of their cloak and take out a smooth metal orb the size of his fist, gently laying it on the table before him. Calennius' eyes twinkle in response to their puzzled reaction.</p>
			<p>"I find hope to be one of our most surprising qualities. Even in the absence of everything else-when the darkness closes in around you with crushing force, hope still burns on all the same. Against impossible odds and unavoidable fates, it, when all others desert you, remains a constant and ever-loyal companion all the same.</p>
			<p>Hope is key, Luthan. Remember it."</p>
			<p>They slide the orb in his direction and he gently picks it up, mind still swirling with thoughts. Nearby Calennius, still watching him intently out of the corner of their eye, stands up and prepares to leave.</p>
			<p>"Thank you," he says abruptly, causing the planeshifter to turn sharply in response. They seemed almost surprised as he gazes in their direction, his expression, for the first time since arriving, not filled with mistrust.</p>
			<p>"You've been better than the rest of them all. Sincerity is something I've found little in this place."</p>
			<p>Calennius pauses slowly - and then, strangely, laughs. "Then you have not seen a fraction of what I am."</p>

			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: The Warden</h3>
			<p>It is said that all actions have an equal and opposite reaction. And so, to counter the expansion of the Cult of the Ascendant Sovereign, so sprung forth the Warden in turn.</p>
			<p>The Warden's motives are simple - to ward off less-developed worlds from all outside influence. It is a shield of sorts protecting them, <i>warding</i> them, as their members proclaim.</p>
			<p>But things are rarely painted in black and white. In truth, the Warden achieves little; while it speaks of the success of its efforts, they are few and far between. Instead of challenging those like Irivex and the Sovereign, it hunts down lesser planeshifters instead, punishing them for frivolous transgressions.</p>
			<p>And so, rather than protecting the Plane, whether intentionally or not, the Warden actively worsens its conditions. Such is the path to our downfall, and such are the hands that spin the threads of fate that we are now resigned to.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>The Backways Bar</h3>
			<p>It was something about their face - was it the distinctive jawline, perhaps? The features so sharp they looked as though they were made for cutting? Perhaps it was those violet eyes, unforgettable as they were.</p>
			<p>Thedra, for as long as Calennius had been in the Bar, had been wondering where she knew them from.</p>
			<p>She was looking at them, staring, trying to steal back the memories she seemed to have lost.</p>
			<p>Of course, her eyes were drawn to the badge on his chest... that symbol, that damned symbol-</p>
			<p>A fragment of a glimpse of a flash of motion. A moment of a vision of a shadow of the past. Thedra's eyes, the metallic spheres implanted in the metallic face, are caught by the red of the badge, and widen to sizes so large that they appear as heads of their own.</p>
			<p>Thedra lets out an audible gasp - a shaky intake of air. She begins to tremble as she begins to remember.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>They were inseparable.</p>
			<p>Glazia was a quiet place. It was a small and insignificant planet with cold temperatures and dreary weather, considered a backwater settlement amidst the thriving Central Nexus of the Greater Plane. It was a planet haunted by forests of grim crooked willows, by fog that came too early and stayed too late. Its residents had simple jobs - farmers, woodcutters, perhaps the occasional export coordinator that delivered shipments of resources from it to distant Mercorra or Tekkeriat.</p>
			<p>It was a planet that to most, was to be passed over; recorded as merely a footnote in an interstellar chart. Nothing had ever happened on Glazia, many said. Nothing, apart from the now-fading exploits of its two most infamous former residents - a pair that, over time, had gained reputations as the most deadly group of assassins for hire in the entirety of the Greater Plane.</p>
			<p>Their names were Mardek and Thedra.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Mardek and Thedra were unique among the many planeshifting mercenaries of the Plane's countless systems. They always came in pairs - you couldn't hire one without paying both in turn. But it made them no less competent; the duo had never failed an assignment before in their lives.</p>
			<p>Though they tended to ignore it, they, over the twenty years of their career, had accumulated an almost-mythical reputation in their planetary system. But for them, life was simple as it was, they didn't need glory or fame - only simply their job - and one another.</p>
			<p>If one were to follow Thedra each dawning morning, leaving her and Mardek's small home at the edge of the Glazian coast, they would wind their way through the dense willow forests, enter a grove of particularly dense trees, and descend into a small grotto beneath the foot of a long-eroded statue. There, they would find a single crimson envelope, marked with the golden seal of a circle slashed with a single crooked line. In it, a letter of the same shade, with a single name.</p>
			<p>Of course, this was no surprise. The letter came every day, and with it, a new name to seek. The two didn't know the letters' source, nor why they had been given the assignment. Yet, they admitted, there was something comforting about ignorance.</p>
			<p>Eventually - after months, a single change was made to the monotony of everyday life. It was ironic, the two would reminisce long afterwards, that something so small could have impacts so grand in turn.</p>
			<p>On that fateful day, the letter under the statue amid the willow trees behind the prison was not crimson, had no flowers - it was violet, with no distinctive markings other than two concentric circles crossed by a single crooked line.</p>
			<p>The color of the letter was not its only unusual quality, however. For one, it carried no assignment; no one to kill, no money to be earned.</p>
			<p>More importantly, it told them from whom the crimson letters had been coming - the Cult of the Ascendant Sovereign.</p>
			<p>Neither Mardek nor Thedra had ever heard of the Cult before.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Neshu, pas Aventaria, was on the brink of freedom at last.</p>
			<p>Fog filled the air as they advanced up the dim corridor ahead, their third eye sweeping the room ahead for signs of magical trails. The red sky had faded to a deep indigo with the approach of sunset - and all had gone to an uneasy silence in the hellish jungle behind them.</p>
			<p>A calm before the storm.</p>
			<p>Steps resound behind them, and the human soldier Aurelion makes his way up the corridor with the apparatus the cultists called a gun leveled in his hands. He had taken it off the last red-robed priest they had encountered, near the back entrance to the outpost.</p>
			<p>Neshu almost smiles as he passes them and advances swiftly ahead; the man's confidence was amusing. They, Neshu admitted, had grown almost fond of him during the time they had spent on the world the cultists called Valaxxa.</p>
			<p>The two had planned their attack for nearly a month. Though the outpost's main entrance was heavily defended, the supply gate, meant to move food, was much less heavily patrolled. They had waited until the end of the guard's shift to slip in, escaping into the heart of the fortress without a shred of suspicion that something was wrong.</p>
			<p>The corridor ahead of them stretched into darkness, a narrow, cramped passageway lit only by the distant light of the entrance. Neshu follows closely behind Aurelion as the two continue along the tunnel.</p>
			<p>"Is there anything ahead?" Aurelion says in a low whisper, squinting at the blackness.</p>
			<p>Neshu shakes their head in response. "I do not believe there to be," they reply. "Yet still be vigilant, soldier."</p>
			<p>At the end of the corridor, Aurelion stops in his tracks, waving for Neshu to pause as well. A rectangular box, as tall as two men and lined with glass framing, sits at the bottom of an even taller chute, extending upon chains into the darkness above.</p>
			<p>Neshu gazes upwards, studying the shadows for signs of magical trails. Once more, all they sense is emptiness - followed by a chilling feeling that something is wrong despite the absence of activity.</p>
			<p>"It's a lift,' Aurelion realizes. "The Capitoline Tower had something similar - but this seems to be automatic."</p>
			<p>Neshu grimaces. Another machine. Neshu had encountered much during their time alive... but seeing such things powered by metal and not magic was still so jarring. This Cult was truly far ahead of even the Empire itself in technological prowess - a revelation that to say the least, was worrying.</p>
			<p>Aurelion steps forwards, touching the edge of the lift. Two prominent buttons are marked upon the device's main wall. The soldier studies them and finally nods. "Do you see that one?" he asks, pointing.</p>
			<p>"You theorize it will send us upwards?"</p>
			<p>Aurelion nods. "It should be safe - it must be used to lift supplies to the uppermost floor."</p>
			<p>"Come on." He waits for the priest to follow as he steps onto the surface of the lift. Though hesitant, they follow, glancing warily at the metal space around them.</p>
			<p>Aurelion presses the topmost button, and immediately afterwards, the doors close with a sudden clank of machinery. A whir sounds below - and then, the lift lurches upwards, gaining speed rapidly as it climbs up the chamber. The two stand in silence for a few moments more before the machine releases a loud click and the doors slide open once more.</p>
			<p>The soldier gasps in surprise.</p>
			<p>Laid in neatly organized heaps upon the shelves ahead were tens - hundreds of planar foci, each of the conical metal devices dancing with pinpricks of red light. Aurelion rushes forwards - and Neshu follows - they'd expected the Cult to have a way out of the planet, but nothing on the sheer scale of this. If this was merely an outpost, how strong truly were their primary holdings?</p>
			<p>Aurelion steps almost reverently up to the shelf directly ahead - and then grabs one of the cones in his hand. He stares at the device slowly, eyes wide with amazement and disbelief.</p>
			<p>"Our way out," he breathes slowly. "Freedom."</p>
			<p>Another voice echoes from the doorway behind them. "Not quite."</p>
			<p>Neshu turns as the room suddenly floods with magical trails, a spiderweb of power that envelops the foci within moments. From the darkness of the lift, a figure clad in black robes approaches, the sigil of the Cult upon their chest.</p>
			<p>As the man advances, they raise a mechanical device in their hands. Their finger snaps against it, and within moments, all the foci around them go dark - save the single one on the priest's belt.</p>
			<p>"You bastard," Aurelion mutters, leveling his gun.</p>
			<p>"What do you want with us, cultist?"</p>
			<p>"Cultist?" the figure says in a silky tone. "Not quite."</p>
			<p>In the darkness of their hood, their eyes suddenly begin to glow with a bright red light.</p>
			<p>Aurelion fires and the figure staggers back momentarily, their head jerked backwards.</p>
			<p>Instead of spilling blood, however, the bullet merely leaves a gaping hole in their forehead - one that, to the soldier's visible horror, the figure is completely undisturbed by. They slowly take off their hood as Aurelion loads the weapon again, revealing a pale, handsome face with eyes the color of molten iron.</p>
			<p>Neshu hisses, backing away steadily and gathering power around them.</p>
			<p>"Lich."</p>
			<p>"The Undying One has sought you for quite some time," the dead man replies. "And most of all, he seeks the one you spoke to in that accursed bar still more."</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Months passed, and Glazia was as quiet as ever; still unchanged despite the chaos now seemingly erupting all around it. The king of Enderia had been dethroned and usurped, the second son of the Tekker pharaoh stolen one of their world's most precious artifacts, and the Cult taken three more planets on the rim of the Nexus - but to most Glazians, it was simply just another day.</p>
			<p>Most Glazians, that was, apart from Mardek and Thedra.</p>
			<p>Mardek and Thedra's reputation had grown even further over the past few months.</p>
			<p>Assignments, which seemed to grow ever more dangerous by every passing day, were now assigned directly; agents of the Cult now had taken an interest in the planet at last, if not solely to meet with the renowned duo.</p>
			<p>It happened directly after one of these tasks - in this case, killing a butcher who was supplying Irivex, a lich, and one of the Cult's primary enemies, with the bones needed to perform some sort of arcane ritual.</p>
			<p>Mardek, who now seemed to drift ever more distant from their home every passing day, was offworld - and that gave Thedra the perfect opportunity to, in her words, revisit their past.</p>
			<p>Despite Mardek's insistence against it, Thedra still checked beneath the tree every day. Of course, letters had stopped showing up there because their assignments were now delivered verbally, but she did so nonetheless, blaming her doings on force of habit.</p>
			<p>Truth be told, she simply wanted to remember the old days. Times were simpler before they knew who was giving them orders, and she preferred it that way.</p>
			<p>And so, she made her way to the grove, descended beneath the statue, and for the first time in months, found a single letter buried within the hollow.</p>
			<p>This letter was a deep violet, in stark contrast to the crimson envelopes that had now been deeply associated with the Cult. Its frame was lightly gilded, and shone even in the dim Glazian sunlight.</p>
			<p>It was clear, Thedra knew, that this was no ordinary message.</p>
			<p>Very carefully, she opened the letter so as to preserve its form, and in it, found a small box made of a reflective silvery metal. Unlatching it revealed one final object - a thin paper note in the very same color as the letter itself.</p>
			<p><i>Associates,</i></p>
			<p><i>We, Great Prophets of the First Well, thank you for your ardent service of the Sovereign. As a reward for your adherence and dedication, you are to be granted a personal audience with the Interpreter, in which you may exchange any information you have for some of our very own knowledge.</i></p>
			<p><i>It should be prefaced that the box which has been sent to you is more than just a container. It is a planar key linked to the planet Talemna, on which he awaits this moment. Simply speak the password "horizon" while holding it to enable its functionality in full.</i></p>
			<p><i>Hail to the Sovereign, Mardek and Thedra. May you find what you seek.</i></p>
			<p>Thedra was conflicted as she mused over the letter, pacing back and forth rapidly.</p>
			<p>It was more than clear that the Cult would be of use to them - and yet, Mardek wasn't here to accompany her this time. They wouldn't be back until the next day, and even then, what if the Cult grew impatient and decided to turn her down? Even as esteemed as they were among their profession, Mardek and Thedra were in no position to make demands of an organization so many times more powerful and influential than they could ever hope to be.</p>
			<p>And in the end, she had her own ambitions too - ones that Mardek simply didn't understand. All Mardek wanted was monotony, a dull, repetitive life without any higher pursuits. They simply couldn't make use of the audience, even if they had the chance to accept it.</p>
			<p>Thedra only wanted the best for both of them, she thought as she rolled the planar key in her palm - and perhaps it would be more beneficial if they simply didn't know about it in the end.</p>
			<p>What choice did she truly have?</p>
			<p>That was what she told herself as she turned over the idea of going by herself in her mind.</p>
			<p>That was what she told herself as she took out the box and activated it.</p>
			<p>That was what she told herself as she found herself sitting in front of a desk.</p>
			<p>And that was what she told herself as she looked the Interpreter in the eye.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Calennius prepared to kill a god.</p>
			<p>Silence pervaded the Throne Hall of Eaon as they slowly stepped towards the looming shape of the jagged obsidian throne ahead, their soft footfalls the only source of sound in the colossal room. For the first time in what now seemed like decades, their throat was dry with nervousness and palms beaded with droplets of sweat.</p>
			<p>Shadows gathered around the edges of the citadel's stained-glass windows, fleeing, dispelled, by the distant glow of the city beyond against the night sky. Smoke stained the black sky, blocking out the glow of the stars above.</p>
			<p>A city in flames. Enderia in revolt.</p>
			<p>Though they were far away from the fighting, Calennius knew they had no easy task of their own to perform.</p>
			<p>Somewhere in the palace, within the labyrinthine maze of obsidian corridors, awaited Xyraith; youngest of the dragons, emperor of Enderia, and bearer of two gods. They were whom the city now riled against; and more importantly, who they now had to kill.</p>
			<p>This very moment had been the culmination of nearly a year of planning - and Calennius knew it could not be wasted now.</p>
			<p>Calennius watched every shadow with wariness as they continued to walk. From the walls, a hundred stone dragons gazed back, their glittering eyes malevolent and unblinking.</p>
			<p>They breathed in visible discomfort - every room in the palace was filled with them; marble serpents wound up jet-black pillars, mosaic beasts with jeweled eyes adorned the walls, and winged reptiles prepared to take flight off tiled roofs. Xyraith had remade the fortress in his own image, a display of power as vain and everlasting as himself.</p>
			<p>The throne itself, as it turned out, was no exception. Its surface carved from tiny obsidian scales, its armrests were shaped to the form of claws and back made from arching stone wings. It spanned nearly as wide as the room itself - making clear the notion that it was not made for any human to sit.</p>
			<p>Calennius warily inspected the seat and then dispelled the illusion around them, their form materializing in a sudden burst of fading magical trails. It had been as they feared; the seat was empty - yet still faintly warm. Xyraith was nowhere to be found, and that could only mean one thing.</p>
			<p>He knew they were here.</p>
			<p>"Assassin."</p>
			<p>Calennius whirled around to find a man standing behind them - tall and dark-haired, clad in crisply cut black robes. Each of their eyes glittered a different color, glowing crimson red and deep black. The hues were reflected in both the golden crown, inlaid with a single scarlet gem, and sheathed sword, bearing a deep black jewel upon its pommel, that the man - no, the dragon, bore.</p>
			<p>Xyraith studied them silently, moving to block their way. Calennius breathed deeply as the sheath glowed - then split apart as a <b>power</b> emerged from within - a shape, blacker than the deepest blackness, the void itself fashioned and molded into the shape of a single terrible Blade.</p>
			<p>Resigned, Calennius lifted their compass and <b>reached</b> into the well of power within. A force stirred in their chest in turn, rapidly surging through them and filling them with a torrent of white-hot power.</p>
			<p>Their eyes began to shimmer as they stared the dragon in the eyes, a rainbow of colors flashing through them and bursting into novas of expanding power.</p>
			<p>Xyraith, however, simply <i>smiled</i> in response.</p>
			<p>"I have long awaited meeting another of us. I relish the prospect of holding another."</p>
			<hr>
			<p>It was clear to Mardek as they stood, frozen stiff-backed in contemplation, that something was terribly wrong.</p>
			<p>They sat inside a tavern, a small, homely, wooden little thing lit by dim electric lights. Mardek spared neither it nor its patrons a glance; this once, they had far more pressing issues on their mind.</p>
			<p>Today, they had received no assignment. Today, Thedra was missing. Today, things were, for the first time in so long, different.</p>
			<p>Mardek, after all, did not particularly enjoy change. Change meant tribulation, and tribulation invariably meant suffering.</p>
			<p>Their musings were disrupted by the appearance of three agents of the Cult of the Ascendant Sovereign.</p>
			<p>Though the tavern stood in the midst of a Cult-controlled city, most of its residents still refrained from parading around in the organization's full attire - but this trio was an evident exception, striding confidently towards them with robes billowing behind them.</p>
			<p>Mardek found it amusing how shrouded in mysticism the Cult was, to the point where some of its lowest-ranking members viewed even planeshifting as some unlearnable arcane art. The foremost Cultist was evidently an example of this, as they strode towards Mardek and told them to "activate the artifact and speak to the master."</p>
			<p>Mardek was promptly handed a silvery gray cube and briefly given instructions on its activation, which they absentmindedly went through.</p>
			<p>The desk at which they appeared moments afterwards was long; wide enough to stretch from one end of the room to the other. The latter was made of a similar material to the cubes; a silvery, reflective metal, catching waves of light upon its surface. Other than the desk and three chairs, which in the rightmost Mardek now sat, the room was completely bare - with little to speak about.</p>
			<p>Mardek was personally content with that. Speech was not their strong suit.</p>
			<p>The same, however, was not true about the figure sitting across from the two mercenaries. The figure was tall - even sitting, it loomed far above Thedra herself. This was due to their strangely stretched proportions - the limbs, torso, and even head were elongated, gaunt and stretched to inhuman extents.</p>
			<p>The Interpreter was wearing one of the Cult's typical robes, albeit a sickly green instead of a bright rose, and was currently engaged in conversation with Thedra.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>The two spoke of many things before Mardek arrived. They discussed first politics - the current state of affairs down on Glazia. They then quickly turned to the topic of conversation for which Thedra had arrived - her own quest for immortality.</p>
			<p>Mardek entered the room silently, appearing in the chair next to her. Even so, Thedra barely spared them a glance; it was almost as if they simply weren't there with her.</p>
			<p>Mardek supposed, as they sat and watched silently, they had little input to give anyways.</p>
			<p>Minutes passed, trickling down upon Mardek and accumulating into hours. Thedra' eyes glittered with a desire like Mardek had never seen before, focused ever-intently on the Interpreter as the two spoke. At last, after what Mardek felt was an eternity, the other figure finally told Thedra of what she was to do next.</p>
			<p>She thanked the Interpreter for their time, and arose from her chair.</p>
			<p>It was only then that she noticed Mardek, sitting there, an intrigued - and even more so, disturbed, expression on their face. The Aspects, as the Interpreter had called them, were the only bit of that conversation that they paid any mind to.</p>
			<p>She looked back to the Interpreter, a question on the edge of her lips, to find them suddenly gone, vanished from sight entirely without a single trace left behind. In a whirl of motion and color afterwards - Thedra found herself back at the statue amid the willow trees behind the empty prison.</p>
			<p>She now had a mission - a greater one than had ever come her way.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>After Thedra left and the Interpreter vanished, Mardek remained, sitting silently within the room.</p>
			<p>They stayed because they had noticed something within it - Mardek, after all, considered themself rather perceptive. Few, they themselves thought, noticed as much as they did, and in this case, they were proven to be true.</p>
			<p>For <i>someone</i> stood in a corner of the room.</p>
			<p>It was a tingling feeling that suddenly ran through their spine. It was the soft sound of dust being kicked up in a corner of the room. It was the soft glitter of a faint ribbon of light as it reflected across something, a near-perfect illusion in the shape of another person.</p>
			<p>It was a figure that stirred ever softly as Mardek stared towards them, realization breaking out across their face.</p>
			<p>"Everyone else is gone," Mardek called out uncertaintly. "If it was one of <i>them</i> you were here for, it's too late. I get the sense I'm the one you're looking for, though."</p>
			<p>"So," they continued, their tone sharpening. "What do you want, and how the hell did you hide yourself from that... thing?"</p>
			<p>The figure appeared in earnest moments afterwards - a head with a sharp nose, below violet-blue eyes and short black hair that shimmered with a silvery glow, sat atop a slim body. A golden compass was nestled in the palm of their hand, its gems aglow with faint whorls of light.</p>
			<p>This figure grinned in response. Evidently, they hadn't expected to be detected - and certainly not by Mardek.</p>
			<p>"Good eye. Formalities aren't something I care too much for, and tonight I have the pleasant excuse of urgency. I'm Calennius - call me Cal, it's lighter on the tongue. That conversation you just heard is one I dearly wish had never occurred, but - unfortunately - I was rather powerless to stop it. That Thedra you... spend so much time around, she's a rather impulsive creature. She may be very <i>well</i> - if you would excuse the pun - creating one of those Aspect Wells she discussed so thoroughly with the Interpreter as we speak. You paid attention to at least <i>that</i> part of the conversation?"</p>
			<p>Calennius paused, waiting for some confirmation from Mardek.</p>
			<p>They simply nodded instead, intrigued with the direction in which Calennius's speech was headed.</p>
			<p>"Unfortunately, these Aspects are rather feisty beasts themselves - despite the Cult's insistence that they can be controlled - they are not so easily tamed. I don't enjoy the prospect of them being unleashed upon the world, so I'm on a bit of a mission to stop this wretched Cult from creating more.</p>
			<p>Suffice it to say, that Interpreter does not have your - nor, indeed, any of our - best interests at heart. You might want to stop your... friend... from making one of these; unless you have some pocket dimension to escape to, you're going to wake up one of these days to eternal darkness."</p>
			<p>Calennius' image began to warp and ripple before they dissipated into a slowly fading mist, scattering into the corners of the room.</p>
			<p>Something Calennius had said had stuck with Mardek. Other, than of course, the part about reality falling apart.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Calennius's shrewd expression, now outlined by the otherworldly glow of a foreign star, broke into a slow grin as they watched Mardek leave the room from the lens of the machine they held in their palm.</p>
			<p>Their plan had been set in motion.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Mardek ran.</p>
			<p>They ran, their body cold with a creeping chill that had nothing to do with the approach of the Glazian winter, past their home, into the willow forests, and towards the statue. Their mind pounded as they made their way forwards, racing with a terror that she had never felt before.</p>
			<p>How could Thedra have done this? What had she been thinking?</p>
			<p>The first sign that something was wrong were the vines. They burst, streaked with red veins and pointed with wickedly sharp barbed thorns, from the center of the grove, wrapping their tendrils around willows that had somehow grown seven times as tall in a day's time.</p>
			<p>Light radiated from the clearing's center - a brilliant, pulsating emerald light that shone with a terrifying glaring intensity. It flickered and shifted as Mardek approached, flaring like a flame that had suddenly been given a newfound burst of power. The light saw them, Mardek could almost have sworn as they ran towards it then, and it <i>hated</i>.</p>
			<p>And in the midst of it all, wrapped in coils of light as she hovered five feet above the ground and chanted in eight different foreign tongues, was Thedra.</p>
			<p>"Thedra!" Mardek yelled, drawing daggers and dashing towards her. "<i>THEDRA!</i> You have no clue what you're doing here- these Aspects are <i>actually</i> dangerous! If you don't quit this... this nonsense, you're going to get us all-"</p>
			<p>The awful green light shifted once more, casting in their direction as Thedra addressed them. Mardek grimaced instinctively and shrinked backwards, the radiance burning their vision and setting it alight with waves of searing pain.</p>
			<p>"Please, will you shut up for a <i>moment</i>?" Thedra demanded, more tendrils of light curling around her as she lifted her arms into the air. "I'm currently achieving my life's goals, and it <i>would</i> be kind of you to not quash my dreams."</p>
			<p>"Thedra - this is <i>insanity</i>," Mardek growled, gesturing grandly. "Can you not see what you're doing?"</p>
			<p>"You win some, you lose some. So what if this world gets a bit torn up? I will FINALLY be immortal! My clock will stop! Do you not realize how... how damned amazing this is?! I can live as long as I damn well please!"</p>
			<p>Mardek opened their mouth to speak, but their voice was drowned out almost immediately by Thedra's voices entering a sudden crescendo.</p>
			<p>Then it began. The tears opened, stretching farther and farther, the very seams of all things splitting apart and cracking to reveal the primordial multitudes between. Light filled their vision, blinding and consuming, an invisible, impossible power stirring and now feeling at the gaping wound that now had opened. And from the metaphysical cosmic pool, <b>it</b> at last emerged, its tendrils feeling tentatively at the world beyond its prison and preparing to emerge for the first time in eternity.</p>
			<p>Thedra's body rose into the air even further, clearly having lost all control of it. Mardek reached out to try and stop her, but to no avail.</p>
			<p>The cosmic tendrils wrapped themselves around Mardek, and pulled them into the warm embrace of the void.</p>
			<p>That simply wouldn't do. Mardek had things to do, and not even a god would stop them here.</p>
			<p>They harnessed Defiance to break free from the bizarre tendrils wrapping around them, mustering all their strength before suddenly releasing it with a single powerful burst. It was a strike powerful enough to turn rock to dust - and yet, in the face of that monstrous light, it didn't even cause the thing to even waver.</p>
			<p>The tendrils started to burn Mardek. Their searing imprinted both a feeling of intense agony and an acute sense of loss - it was as though the tendrils were taking fragments of Mardek's very soul.</p>
			<p>Nearby, Thedra, now fallen onto the ground, was writhing on the ground, her face in her hands. As she struggled, for a split second, she noticed Mardek being drawn into the Well. Before she could act, however, her vision was obscured by another pounding wave of viridescent light.</p>
			<p>Mardek fought against the tendrils with every ounce of strength they had. They looked down at themself - their skin was disintegrating before their very eyes; ripped apart and taken ahold of, tiny miniscule arms embedding inside them, and the pain took them over and they felt nothing but the tendrils and the arms and the skin stretching and tearing and they knew nothing but the overwhelming sensation of their flesh being consumed and soon their world would be taken too too but that meant nothing to them anymore because they were dying, they must be dying, they knew they were dying.</p>
			<p>The whirl of pain stopped abruptly, leaving Mardek completely breathless. Their vision was going dark. Dimly, they saw Thedra, her face mangled beyond recognition, holding up a metal plate.</p>
			<p>Fighting a god alone.</p>
			<p>Then darkness overcame their vision at last, and a single foreign voice cried out in their mind.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Thedra held the metal plate. It had once been a shield in a worn statue, defending a man too dead to use it. She gripped the edges of it, held on to them as a drowning man would a rope, as the cosmic tendrils grasped at it, blindly whipping at it in their fury. They burned it, burned away the rust of decades, melded it into a new shape.</p>
			<p>The molten iron dripping down Thedra's hands caused her more pain than she had ever felt in her life, but she held fast. She would survive, she would save Mardek, and she would confront that bastard who told her to make this damned Well and tear out his heart. The tendrils continued to shape and reshape the shield, which was now barely offering Thedra more defense then her bare hands would. A sudden surge of power, unfathomable and unstoppable, flooded through her body as the tendrils reached forwards and enveloped her, taking hold of the plate entirely and reaching further and further yet. They wound up her arms, climbed up her neck, and then, still grasping, split open the seams of her skin, forced open the lids of her eyes, and made their way in, tearing, ripping, growing anew and mending.</p>
			<p>And then, for a moment, there, even as darkness fell across her, she saw it all.</p>
			<p>It was the power of Growth.</p>
			<p>Growth that sprung from the earth and embraced the rays of the sun and reached higher and higher until an ancient tree, weathered by eons, rose in all its majesty from the soil.</p>
			<p>Growth that hungered and consumed and devoured until a jungle of twisting vines and biting thorns spanned between the horizons.</p>
			<p>Growth that ate at all it could reach until nothing was left, until the land was barren and only it remained, dying, dead and yet still seeking sustenance, an unstoppable, primordial force born in the very first breaths of all existence.</p>
			<p>And it was what she sought. It was immortality, twisted as it may be - but still powerful all the same. The power that she had craved all her life, dreamt of every passing moment.</p>
			<p>And so, even as Mardek struggled below, she embraced it - leaning into it and letting it flood through her, washing up her body with a warmth like she had never felt before. Her eyes closed - and even blinded, she saw green - endless seas of blissful, comforting green, that spread and spread and spread and spread...</p>
			<p>Thedra, had she not been blinded by the Well, may have noticed it getting smaller. She may have noticed the tendrils, too, shrinking in both size and power.</p>
			<p>She, however, saw nothing. All she knew was that one moment, she was being seared by the metal of the shield, and the next moment, she wasn't.</p>
			<p>She felt the reshaped shield, a shield no longer. It seemed to have a face engraved on it - she guessed, correctly, that it was now a mask of some sort. She held it up to her face, and suddenly could see once more.</p>
			<p>She also noted that she seemed to have two new arms - made of both the coiling red-veined vines and the very same metal, now stretched thin, that had once composed the statue's arms.</p>
			<p>Dimly, she wondered where they came from.</p>
			<p>Thedra, too, collapsed to the ground, drained by the pain and the creation of the Well.</p>
			<p>There they laid, minds full of darkness, for hours on end.</p>
			<p>Eventually, they both got up, and, without saying a word to each other, parted ways.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Calennius wasted no time in responding. Reaching forwards, they sent a stream of power forth from their hands, engulfing Xyraith in a red-hot inferno. They stepped towards him and fanned the flames, blasting the dragon with searing crimson torrents.</p>
			<p>The barrage lasted a minute before they stepped back and relinquished their hold, watching the inferno dissipate.</p>
			<p>From its midst, seemingly wholly unaffected by the barrage, Xyraith emerged, somehow completely intact even up to his very robes.</p>
			<p>Xyraith advanced forwards and swung the Blade through the air, trailing inky black nothingness. Calennius called upon Matter and raised their palms upwards in response, feeling the power respond in their chest. Formed from the very essence of creation, a shimmering blade of crystal appeared in their hands, poised to block Xyraith's blow.</p>
			<p>Xyraith brought the Blade down and met the crystal sword with a single forceful swing, causing it to vanish immediately upon contact. The dragon's strike met empty air as Calennius retreated backwards, forming another crystal blade in their hands.</p>
			<p>Xyraith advanced again, increasing his pace and lifting the Blade up once more. Calennius blocked another crushing swing, dodging to the side and narrowly avoiding the blow as the sword flashed through the air.</p>
			<p>They could almost feel the dragon's irritation as he made his way forwards, growling deep in his throat. Calennius smiled. The longer they could prolong this, the better the outcome would be.</p>
			<p>This time, Xyraith dashed towards him, the Blade warping the air around it as he pursued Calennius. The planeshifter stood firm in response, meeting the dragon's gaze with crystal blade held at the ready. Xyraith's pace increased, his form casting looming shadows upon the floor as he leaped up and then slashed down, a vicious swing that arced forwards with incredible speed and strength.</p>
			<p>Calennius only closed their eyes in response, raising their arms and standing perfectly still. Xyraith plunged the blade into their chest, eyes wrathful-and then stared in horror as it split into gleaming rays of light.</p>
			<p>Calennius' eyes gleamed. The trick had worked perfectly - by dispelling their blade upon contact with the dragon's illusionary sword, they had successfully deceived him into coming close enough to strike.</p>
			<p>Calennius reached forwards and manifested the Blade in their hands. They had stolen it while Xyraith had been blinded by the firestorm-and had waited, biding their time, for the emperor to come within melee distance. In a quick, powerful motion, they stabbed Xyraith in the chest, trails of Antithetical power flooding down the blade and coursing into the cavity that the weapon had made.</p>
			<p>"Power," Calennius said, embedding the weapon deeper in the dragon's chest, "always turns on you when you least expect it."</p>
			<p>Calennius ripped the Blade away, leaving Xyraith to collapse on the ground. Eyes glowing a brilliant red, Xyraith's mouth was agape in an expression of wordless horror as he began to disintegrate, body fading into trails of drifting crimson smoke.</p>
			<p>Calennius waited for a few moments before bending down, ready to take the crown from the dragon's head. And then, even as his body crumbled away - Xyraith, lurching forwards with a desperate glow in his eyes, took <i>hold</i> of the hilt and plunged it into their chest.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Death came to all things, and even Glazia was no exception.</p>
			<p>The quiet world had been claimed by war at last. Its forests of willows burned, gusts of smoke drifting into the air and painting it ashen gray. Its graves were upturned and empty, coastlines red with torrents of spilled blood. Glazia had become the setting for one of the bloodiest conflicts in the very Central Ring - as if the planet had finally paid for its idyllic vision at last.</p>
			<p>For Irivex had come to Glazia, seeking a new world to take as his own. And with him in turn, all the might of his horde.</p>
			<p>The dead roamed overtaken streets in uncountable multitudes, commanded by looming figures with eyes of molten crimson. The Terror Generals, twelve ancient planeshifters sustained only by entropic power, with bodies carved more from metal than flesh. The hordes had laid waste to all before them - and now they marched towards one of the last cities remaining, where the remnants of the Glazian armies stood in anticipation.</p>
			<p>And there the battle raged.</p>
			<p>It was as if a colossal, sadistic god had hit the battlefield with giant crushing fists, pounding it over and over and over again, beating it into slivers of shreds of its former shape. The ground was torn, shredded, split open with cracks running for hundreds of feet; there were sinkholes, magically ripped open, with too many corpses to count lining their bottoms, and still, the fighting continued. Soldiers, thinking they finally had some purpose in their lives, threw themselves at each other, exploding in gushing fountains of blood and gore. Planeshifters wielding inhuman amounts of magical power tore holes in the fabric of reality, and fought each other there, ripping tiny demiplanes into being and collapsing them as they struggled and died.</p>
			<p>And amidst it all, reveling in the carnage, stood one that loomed above all the rest.</p>
			<p>Irivex stood, seven feet at the shoulder, a hulking abomination of metal and flesh. Dressed in a tattered cloak, the lich carved a swathe through all he met, spilling gushing fountains of blood upon the floor as he advanced. Torrents of magic swirled around him - blighting all they touched upon contact. Irivex tore open the Plane itself in his frenzy, ripping planeshifters out of the very void and killing them on the spot.</p>
			<p>The full force of Entropy, unleashed. The wrath of an unchained god.</p>
			<p>None opposed Irivex. How could one even hope to stand against entropy itself?</p>
			<p>And so, the gathered soldiers cowered and ran, breaking formation and fleeing for their lives. They leaped through rifts, scrambled into the city behind them, or simply closed their eyes and accepted their fate. All, except two foolhardy heroes, who had come together at last after years spent apart, standing alone in the midst of it all.</p>
			<p>They seemed but children in Irivex's shadow - one of them stood barely taller than his waist.</p>
			<p>While all erupted into chaos around them, they stood resolutely, facing Irivex on the battlefield. He would have ignored them entirely, thought them merely foolish soldiers who knew not his true power, had he not recognized one of them.</p>
			<p>Here, standing before him, was the very same bastard who had dared to capture a god of her own.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Whatever Thedra had lost after the opening of the well, it was certainly not her pride.</p>
			<p>Thedra enjoyed flashy battles, and as Irivex approached, she prepared to call out her name, to make a lasting mark in the legends for herself as the one that defeated the lich in combat. She stepped forwards and tapped into Growth, causing a tangle of twisting scarlet-veined vines to erupt from her arms as she cleared her throat in anticipation.</p>
			<p>Mardek did no such thing.</p>
			<p>As Irivex whirled around to face the two, Mardek compelled Shadow. They did so a moment too late, however, and Irivex turned his head sharply, watching as Mardek faded into invisibility.</p>
			<p>He did not care in the slightest.</p>
			<p>Irivex decided to humor Thedra. It had been long since he had last faced such a confident opponent, and defeating them would be all the better of an experience.</p>
			<p><b>"And what,"</b> he spoke, voice rumbling like grinding gears and rending flesh, <b>"may be the names of my assailants?"</b></p>
			<p>Thedra spoke first - she'd long since known what her answer would be. She wouldn't die on this day - they'd both made arrangements to prevent any possibility of that beforehand. Yet it was still better to use a false name - Thedra had no inclination to be hunted down by Irivex through the remainder of her life.</p>
			<p>She spoke in a new voice; her characteristic accent would not serve her for the purpose at hand. Deep and booming, it echoed through the charred field, amplified by Growth to resounding extents.</p>
			<p>"I am the great warrior Devarien! Legend of the white seas, hero of the deep, conqueror of a thousand worlds!"</p>
			<p>Irivex chuckled. Though the lie was a blatant one, he admired her tenacity for it all the same.</p>
			<p>Mardek, who had snuck behind Irivex, compelled Harm, and Irivex winced. Mardek's sword passed straight through him, its blade piercing him cleanly without a single spilt drop of blood.</p>
			<p><b>"That was a low blow. When did chivalry die?"</b></p>
			<p>With a single hand, Irivex picked them up and flung them to the floor.</p>
			<p><b>"You remind me of another. Alas, it seems, you are far less competent. Now utter your final words."</b></p>
			<p>Thedra leapt at him, and all hell broke loose.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>The fighting continued after the battle stopped. Though the charred field was empty, with both its soldiers and Irivex's horde long since gone, the three continued to duel unceasingly.</p>
			<p>Eventually, the lich finally spoke.</p>
			<p>Thedra and Mardek were standing, poised to strike Irivex, waiting for something to happen. No one had made a move, and Irivex projected his deep growl of a "voice" into the minds of the two once more.</p>
			<p><b>"I was ill-equipped to deal with warriors of your... prowess. Shall this fight continue on much longer, I may find myself too exhausted to continue, and you would claim victory. I, however, would propose a solution more beneficial to all involved. I shall make an offer to both of you. Should you both choose to accept, you would lay down your arms, and join me in my conquest. Should one of you choose to accept, I would have the two of you do battle, the one who accepts in my stead. Should neither of you choose to accept, I would flee, and you would be pursued by my Generals to the end of your days."</b></p>
			<p>He then spoke to each one of them, in turn. He began with Mardek.</p>
			<p><b>"I have probed your mind, and it is dark. You care not for the suffering of this mortal coil. If you were to accept my offer, you would join me, along with your cohort of 'friends', and I would grant you your own domain. You would live the rest of your days in freedom... save an occasional assignment I would command of you."</b></p>
			<p>Mardek made a vulgar hand gesture at him.</p>
			<p>"I don't give a damn about you and your promises of hope. If you truly believe we can fell you, that's what's going to happen."</p>
			<p>Irivex grinned, and turned to Thedra.</p>
			<p><b>"And you, my friend. You want salvation - not only for yourself, but for all. You want the power to act - to protect this world from the clutches of the Cult, from the Aspects, from... me.</b></p>
			<p><b>And you cannot deny the truth. The weakness of those around you. It binds you, restrains you, holds you back from achieving your true potential.</b></p>
			<p><b>You have far more power than you know - the very soul of a god intertwined with yours. I will teach you how to use it - and you will grow stronger than you ever imagined you ever could.</b></p>
			<p><b>Strong enough to save the Plane. Strong enough, perhaps one day, to dethrone even me.</b></p>
			<p><b>The truth awaits, Devarien."</b></p>
			<p>Thedra closed her metallic eyes. A single tear rolled down her mask.</p>
			<p>A silent, salty drop.</p>
			<p>"I'm sorry, Mardek," she whispered.</p>
			<p>Irivex began to laugh - a terrible, screeching sound like tearing metal and ripping flesh.</p>
			<p>A crossbow bolt, surrounded by an aura of brilliant magic, flew through the air.</p>
			<p>At that moment, with their closest friend having betrayed them and now attacking them, with everything they had worked for fallen to pieces because of Thedra's betrayal, Mardek's mind broke.</p>
			<p>They ran.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Neshu is the first to respond, closing their eyes and pressing their palms together immediately. Aurelion steps backwards hastily as their skin begins to glow, coursing with waves of violet light as tendrils of power erupt from the walls and rip stones from the floor. In a whirlwind of indigo and torn rock, the stones meld together, forming a towering construct in the shape of a crude man.</p>
			<p>The lich steps forwards and is immediately hit by a huge stone fist, pressed against the wall with a crash of falling debris. Red eyes begin to glow in the creature's sockets - and the rock suddenly bursts into pieces, torn asunder by trails of crimson power. Neshu growls in response and the construct reaches into the floor, a new hand forming as concrete lifts from the floor and is pulled within.</p>
			<p>The lich sighs, pulling out its planar key. As the construct steps forwards, it vanishes into a rift on the ground, appearing a few paces behind Neshu. Aurelion leaps forwards before the creature can act, slashing down with a single heavy blow and and loping off its arm. It merely hisses in response before vanishing once more, its limb regrowing as it appears at the far side of the room.</p>
			<p>"How do we kill... that thing?" Aurelion asks as the two fall back.</p>
			<p>"I do not know, soldier," Neshu muses. "Keep it distracted for now. I…will think of something."</p>
			<p>Aurelion inhales deeply. "Are you sure?"</p>
			<p>Neshu nods in response. "I am."</p>
			<p>Aurelion breathes in once more and dashes towards the lich, whose eyes glitter in amusement. Behind him, Neshu falls cross-legged on the floor, their eyes glowing the same bright violet as the tendrils surrounding the stone construct.</p>
			<p>Both Aurelion and the construct advance on the lich. He readies his sword and moves in, raising the weapon in a defensive stance. It gazes at the two warily before turning, drawing a wicked scimitar in response.</p>
			<p>Aurelion moves in, slashing forth with his blade. His attack is quickly met by the lich's own parry, causing him to stumble backwards.</p>
			<p>The construct attacks as Aurelion retreats. Raising hands upwards, it barely misses the lich as the two fists crash down, leaving a gaping crater in the floor. A rift forms nearby and the creature appears behind it, its hands now enveloped in vortexes of crimson.</p>
			<p>The lich's palm glows red and its fist collides with the construct's leg. Cracks of scarlet light appear as the lich punches once more, causing more spiderwebbing fractures to form. Before Aurelion can react, the rock collapses and the construct shatters, hurtling back into the wall.</p>
			<p>The dead man's eyes are alight with silent gloating as it steps towards him. He raises his blade, only for it to be torn in two after red cracks split it apart.</p>
			<p>"Call off your friend," it demands, "and you will suffer much less in the Undying Lord's hands."</p>
			<p>Aurelion growls. "We all know what you did. You damnable things slaughtered <i>countless</i> innocent Imperial civilians. Go to Daekkan's Hells."</p>
			<p>The walls seem to rumble nearby, and Aurelion raises his voice.</p>
			<p>"Our move, bastard," Aurelion growls.</p>
			<p>The lich looks up for a moment before the construct, now enlarged to immense sizes, emerges from the wall and tears away a massive slab of stone, raising it above its head. It slams it down forcefully, causing the dead man to plunge through the floor into a gaping chasm beneath it. Moments later, the now hulking construct too collapses, filling the hole with debris and burying the lich far beneath.</p>
			<p> Aurelion scurries away from the edge of the chasm - where the lich's severed hand, torn from its body and still carrying the planar key, lays inanimately. He breathes in relief as Neshu rises, taking the device in his own hand and studying it.</p>
			<p>Dread sinks in moments later, suddenly creeping up his spine with a chilling feeling. He had feared as much - and now, the worst of the possibilities he had imagined had been confirmed.</p>
			<p>"Neshu?" he asks, breathing deeply. "We have a problem. There's... only enough power in this for one charge. And an unstable one, only capable of carrying one."</p>
			<p>He closes his eyes. "I've decided that I-"</p>
			<p>Neshu cuts him off immediately. "That is why you will go alone."</p>
			<p>Aurelion's eyes widen. "You can't possibly mean-"</p>
			<p>"I do," they respond, their own gaze now hard and resolute. They reach into their robes slowly and pull out a worn sheet of paper, tossing it to the floor by him. "I am sorry, soldier."</p>
			<p>Aurelion bends down and picks it up. His expression turns to shock as he reads it, his frame trembling softly. His eyes are alight with a multitude of jumbled emotions; anger, worry, fear.</p>
			<p>"How long did you have this?" he asks softly.</p>
			<p>"A month," Neshu responds.  "I did not fully trust you then. I believed I could use it to gain... leverage."</p>
			<p>"But I must admit," they correct, "you are much different from what I once believed you to be. This Augusta saw so much in you - her hopes hinged on your freedom. I could not let you die here."</p>
			<p>Aurelion tentatively steps forward and waves the planar key through the air, opening a rift into a distant landscape.</p>
			<p>Neshu nods in encouragement.</p>
			<p>His eyes close, a single tear dripping down his cheek. "I will come back," he says. "I will, I swear upon it."</p>
			<p>The rift had began to close, shrinking with every passing moment. Neshu nodded resolutely in response.</p>
			<p>"Go. Go now. I will keep the lich bound."</p>
			<p>Aurelion gave them one last look as he stepped through the rift and vanished.</p>
			<p>And then Neshu, pas Anaclaria, was alone in the world once more.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Mardek, as Thedra had quickly learned in the following days, proved to be far from easy to hunt down.</p>
			<p>During their time as mercenaries, Thedra had seen the extent of their capabilities herself before - and now, they were only refined to even further extents.</p>
			<p>They covered their tracks almost perfectly well, went by a thousand different names, had numerous paths out of every situation. It would have been a living nightmare for her if she didn't have connections, too - connections she was now being forced to utilize.</p>
			<p>The bouncer, a sturdy man evidently concealing daggers in two billowing sleeves, let her into the small tavern ahead at a glance - Thedra wasn't an easy person to forget, and her reputation preceded her. The inn she now entered, drawing numerous pairs of eyes immediately as she stepped through the doorway, was, of course, a front - as were half of the shops in the town - a front for the Black Guilds.</p>
			<p>The government of this particular world knew the Guilds as a "corporation". The people knew the Guilds as a "mafia". In reality, it was somewhere in between the two. Certainly, it had its roots in criminal enterprises, but it ran a <i>couple</i> legitimate businesses. This inn happened to be one of them. It also happened to be a meeting place for the Guilds - where even disguised kings and cloaked princes were considered normal by its bargoers.</p>
			<p>Even so, the inn went deathly quiet when Thedra walked in.</p>
			<p>Without saying a single word, Thedra walked past the stunned patrons, past the silent bartender, past the quiet tables and empty chairs, and towards the door, its steel surface painted to look like mahogany wood, at the end of the room. She smiled at the looks of shock before promptly calling upon Growth as she reached it. A mass of red-veined vines erupted from the ground beneath it, tearing it from its hinges and tossing it on the floor behind her.</p>
			<p>People, Thedra had learned from her new mentor, got things done faster when they were scared.</p>
			<p>The man sitting across from Thedra, behind it, she noticed as she retracted her arms and sat down, was almost a stereotype unto himself. Short, plump, and accented, he resembled almost perfectly well a man of his profession-a weathered con artist, leader of an established cadre. Even so, this fellow wasn't the real boss - just a regional manager of sorts.</p>
			<p>Pleasantries were exchanged, and then business began. Thedra had been a client of the Guilds before - hell, she had <i>worked</i> for the Guilds before. Combined with the sheer force of her presence-the dealings went quickly. Everyone in the Guilds - from bagman to high mage, was now looking for Mardek in the span of a few moments.</p>
			<p>As Thedra thought as she left, power could get one quite far in the world.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>After the terrifying demi-human left the room, the plump man smiled to himself before waving his hand and setting the door back into its frame.</p>
			<p>However much the bribe, the Guilds weren't going to be sending men after its very own leader.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>In four hours, Mardek would finally find freedom at last.</p>
			<p>Mardek gazed at their throne as they paced alongside the corridor ever-restlessly. It was cut from solid greenstone, shimmering even in the hallways' dim light, with the designs of various weaponry carved upon the seat. It was a perfect representation of the Guilds - not because of the weapons, but because of the impracticality and unnecessary garnishes.</p>
			<p>It was a throne that a hundred men would each have to labor for a hundred years to afford, and it was uncomfortable as all hell itself. Men would kill for a single sliver of this throne, and yet Mardek avoided sitting on it all the same, fearing it would collapse upon touch.</p>
			<p>After some time, Mardek finally raised their gaze from the wall. There was still work to be done, and even surrounded by such a wretched den of criminals and scum, they had to make do of what they had.</p>
			<p>Mardek sighed. Even having near-infinite wealth, the accumulated plunder of entire planetary systems, they still had to deal with <i>others</i> in the end.</p>
			<p>Mardek pushed the doors to their chambers open with a strange ease, pointedly ignoring the greenstone coatings upon the walls and floor as they passed. They sauntered gallantly out of their chambers, their indigo robes billowing heroically behind them.</p>
			<p>They did everything this way. They simply had to - it was expected of them, as the leader of the Guilds. Gallantry, pride, honor, whatever name it took, hypocritical as it was in such an organization, was still revered so much nonetheless - even over actual competence.</p>
			<p>They were fools, all of them, Mardek thought as they passed through the corridor, saluting to the armored sentinels along the corridor, to value the shadow of confidence over true ability - but as it stood, it was a tool that could be harnessed nonetheless.</p>
			<p>They began to prepare. In four hours' time, the Realm they had dreamed of for so long would finally be a reality. They had sent messengers out to Calennius and Ranjj, one of their associates - unlike everything else in this god-forsaken mafia, at least <i>those</i> were competent. They would get their job done - they were sure of it.</p>
			<p>In four hours' time, Mardek would finally be free of the shackles of this awful world.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Mardek stood, along with the Guild's eleven most powerful mages, around the circle as it began to glow a deep crimson red.</p>
			<p>In the past four hours, they had set up numerous decorations alongside it; candles of ghostly fire, the hides of magically potent animals, and arcane symbols were piled along the cold stone floor - but the ritual itself was, in fact, quite simple. It was a mere process of transferring power - of exchange, great magical input for even greater results.</p>
			<p>Calennius stood besides them, their vibrant and yet still unnervingly cold eyes fixated upon the circle. Though they were evidently competent - as much as - or even more, than Mardek themselves, something about them still chilled the latter to their bones nonetheless. Of all those Mardek had met in their endeavors, they were certainly the least trustworthy of them all.</p>
			<p>Yet the time had not come to worry about them. For now, they had a Realm to create.</p>
			<p>Mardek felt a stir of excitement in their chest - a rare emotion, and one swiftly followed by feelings of creeping doubt.</p>
			<p>Finally, the years of pain would be worth it. Mardek would escape into their Realm, the others would show up - perhaps even Thedra, one day, and Mardek would be able to live out the rest of their days happily, unaffected by the treachery of the Greater Plane.</p>
			<p>Yet even so, the specter of failure still seemed to loom in a distant corner of Mardek's mind. They had originally planned for sixteen mages, even with the strength of the two. A third of Mardek's power had planned to join them - an associate from distant Tekkeriat that Mardek had taken to calling Range. Calennius had been confident of their help; and yet, Range had still not arrived.</p>
			<p>In truth, Mardek now thought silently to themselves, they doubted they would ever come.</p>
			<p>But there was no time for it - not now. All that was needed was action.</p>
			<p>The sun reached its highest point in the sky, and the twelve started chanting.</p>
			<p>As the voices reached a sudden crescendo, Mardek stepped into the middle of the red-dust circle. The ground below them began to glow, and everything exploded.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>The voices went off in Mardek's head again. They had grown accustomed - as accustomed as one can grow - to living with the constant torment, the prodding mockery and threats and vile insults that they now heard in their mind - an unbroken, the unbreakable stream of hatred, of indifference, of loss.</p>
			<p>Everything was a haze. Mardek watched as Calennius, without even a single speck of ash on their unblemished face, turned and walked away, unglancing at the piled corpses nearby as they opened a rift into a foreign landscape. A blazing pain seared the edges of their mind, but Mardek paid it no heed. The voices simply drowned out it all.</p>
			<p>As Mardek lay on the ground, unmoving but not unconscious, the voices reminded them of every one of their failures, every time anything bad ever happened to them and how they drove off Thedra with their indifference and their apathy and failed to protect her from her own self and they were now trying to escape all of it because they were too cowardly to do anything else and now some Cultists were taking them away and Mardek dimly remembered a time when the Cultists would bow in their wake but they had driven those times off just like they drove off everyone who ever cared about them and everyone they had ever cared about.</p>
			<p>It was enough to make one go insane.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Mardek had lost it all again.</p>
			<p>They woke to the dripping of water - the slow, steady rhythm of droplets falling from the stone roof onto the cold floor of the cell around them. Mardek groaned in annoyance as they sat up and surveyed their surroundings, gathering their now-drenched cloak in their hands.</p>
			<p>The cell was bare - a tiny room furnished with a single cot, walled off by steel bars that glowed with tiny magical inscriptions. Runes imbued with wards of strength, evidently; but weak ones for that, enough to be broken with a single burst of Defiance.</p>
			<p>They knew they could escape in a moment's notice; return to the Guilds in victory and perhaps reattempt the ritual again. Magical power could be bought, Ranjj and Calennius spoken with, even the mages replaced.</p>
			<p>Something, however, had stopped them.</p>
			<p>When conducting the ritual, they had noticed something strange. Their Enigma wasn't being depleted... at all; almost as though the magic of the eleven mages was enough.</p>
			<p>So they had probed further. It seemed that while the power it had taken to sever the Realm's ties was enough, they didn't have the means to do so all the same. It was if they were opening a door with the wrong key - with the finer details, it didn't matter how much force you were applying.</p>
			<p>And strangest of all, they hadn't seemingly performed the entire ritual wrong even so. It seemed that a sliver of power had actually done its job - coming, unsurprisingly, from Calennius.</p>
			<p>Mardek sighed. Of course it had always come to them.</p>
			<p>Mardek harnessed Defiance and walked straight through the locked door. The basement really was an awful holding cell, they thought as they looked back; the Cult members who had taken them must've been as incompetent as their own men.</p>
			<p>They walked out from the basement, quickly killing the four guards in their path, and stepped out onto a cobbled street lit by the glow of three moons. They slashed their planar key through the air casually as they made their way into a back alley, stepping into the newly created rift and blinking away from sight.</p>
			<p>All that was left now was to find Range.</p>

				<h3 class="exclude">Enigma and Enigmatic Foci</h3>
				<p>...</p>
				<p>Rogue magics are fueled, instead, by a similar force named Enigma. Though arcane magics are, of course, arcane, Enigma is far less known. It has rather different properties, but functions so similarly that it is often mistaken for Mana. Mardek's title as the "Arcane Without Mana" stems wholly from this, as they often wield their mastery of Enigma with, ah, more <i>showmanship</i> than most rogues, going so far as to wield Enigma for no more than dramatic effect, where most rogues would eschew the use of Enigma with witnesses at all.</p>
				<p>There are five foci by which Enigma is typically channeled, and five classical classifications of rogue, with each using two halves of a focus.</p>
			</span>
			<hr>
			<p>Thedra woke to a knock on the door.</p>
			<p>She stirred from the pool of mana in which she floated, eyes closed and arms splayed to her sides in a relaxed pose. The prismatic liquid power, shaped to a similar buoyancy to saltwater, coursed through her, filling her with a comforting spreading warmth. Irivex was far from a moral figure, but to say that her allegiance to him had few benefits was simply untrue. On this world, the mana within the pool was enough to be exchanged for a small estate.</p>
			<p>Thedra rose, her expression darkening as another knock pierced the calm, and called upon Growth. Vines snaked across the ground and ripped the door from its frame, slamming it to the floor nearby. She paid little heed to it as she stepped out of the pool; doors came cheap, cheaper than flesh.</p>
			<p>Three figures stood in the doorway, each as tall as the corridor itself. Their eyes glowed deep shades of red, illuminating their once-human bodies and the metal plates that covered rotting flesh beneath. Each a figure of legend on many now-desolate worlds, the Terror Generals waited with gauntleted hands folded, stares almost meek as they watched her approach.</p>
			<p>"Commander, we have some rather unfortunate news," the central General said. Ixilscor, as he was known, but Thedra simply referred to him as Idiot instead.</p>
			<p>"The one you seek has disappeared once more."</p>
			<p>Of course the news was bad. When was there ever <i>good</i> news coming from these morons who called themselves Generals?</p>
			<p>Thedra collapsed back into the pool of mana with a heavy sigh -  it looked like Mardek had slipped through her fingers again. Their sheer capacity to escape sticky situations would have been almost commendable, were it not so <i>damn irritating</i> now.</p>
			<p>Idiot continued, seemingly oblivious to Thedra's state of annoyance.</p>
			<p>"We arrived at the destination you indicated, however, we were met there by agents from the Cult of the Ascendant Sovereign. They fled faster than we could follow. The insurgent is currently housed on one of the planets controlled by the Cult, and there we cannot enter; the Cult has impassable defense systems in place."</p>
			<p>Thedra decided that the situation did not call for urgency. She would find Mardek, given time - she knew where they were, now, and some Cultists couldn't stop her. She decided to use her false voice for dramatic effect - she could have some fun, after all, watching the fools flounder to capture them once more.</p>
			<p>A soft, high-pitched, southern voice cut through the air, dripping with waves of acrid disappointment.</p>
			<p>"So you're telling me that you left Mardek to some Cultists? You, the Terror Generals?! Don't you have a reputation to maintain?"</p>
			<p>She let on an overly dramatic and exasperated sigh, but internally smiled - the Generals looked abashed at her disappointment, and she did like how high of opinions they held of her. Power was one thing, but respect was entirely another.</p>
			<p>A different General - Koross, as judging by the bones that hung from his neck and coated his armor in morbid clacking platings, spoke. His voice came out in a soft lisp, echoing with the quality of falling sand.</p>
			<p>"Commander, these were no ordinary Cultists. The Cult had sent planeshifters after the rebel. They are of considerably... more... strength... than... "</p>
			<p>Koross slowed his speech to a halt as he saw Thedra massaging her steel temple.</p>
			<p>"Planeshifters? You were stopped by planeshifters? They're run-of-the-mill Cultists! You're planeshifters, hell, <i>everyone's a planeshifter!</i> If you can't deal with them, gods know you won't be able to deal with Mardek!"</p>
			<p>The Generals looked uncertainly at each other, not entirely sure how to respond. Even lesser Cult planeshifters were highly skilled and powerful all the same - eight or nine of them working in harmony might even be able to take down a General. Perhaps Thedra was powerful enough to swat them like flies, but the Generals were nowhere near as strong as she.</p>
			<p>Thedra rolled the metal spheres that served as eyes on her mask.</p>
			<p>"I guess I'll have to get them myself. Why does Irivex even hire you people?"</p>
			<p>Without giving the Generals a chance to respond, Thedra bolted over to the other side of the room at her uncanny speed, kicked the door out of the way, and shoved her way past the terrified Generals. She was out of the room within seconds.</p>
			<p>If nobody else could bring back Mardek, then she would have to take matters into her own hands.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>The pain was immeasurable.</p>
			<p>It was an agony that Calennius had never experienced before. It rent at their very soul, ripping it apart once and once again as they held onto the threads of life, turning cycles of destruction and reformation. They would not die; the power they held made sure of it; but the pain itself was almost worse than even death.</p>
			<p>Calennius screamed as they fell to the floor, pulling out the Blade with cold hands and gritting their teeth to stomach the unceasing torment. They inched, crawling forward slowly towards the Crown, which lay lifelessly, its gem almost dull, a few feet in front of them.</p>
			<p>A cold chill swept through the room.</p>
			<p>A rift split open in the air behind the throne, stretching and expanding rapidly until it was over eight feet tall. Irivex strode from the gateway, bending down and picking up the Crown with a jagged metal claw. Crimson tendrils flooded from the gem and into the lich's hand, surging up his steel-clad frame.</p>
			<p>Irivex circled Calennius, eyes gloating. Behind his mask, they were the only remnant of what he had formerly been.</p>
			<p>"Old friend," he rasped softly.</p>
			<p>Calennius struggled as they knelt, staring up at the lich despite the immense pain. They prepared to rise, but fell to their knees immediately afterwards, crushed by a new torrent of agony.</p>
			<p>"Damn you... How... how could you have done that to her?"</p>
			<p>Irivex's expression made a mockery of kindliness. "I told you to not get in my way. What else could I have done when she chose not to follow it?"</p>
			<p>Calennius hissed, their face convulsed in pain. "I will kill you. One day, I will. I swear on it."</p>
			<p>Irivex laughed. "We shall see."</p>
			<p>The lich turned towards the now-closing rift and began to step through.</p>
			<p>"Goodbye, Cal. Perhaps you'll finally forget her someday."</p>
			<p>Calennius raised their head up, eyes swimming with tears, and howled towards the cold black sky.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Glazia was a quiet place.</p>
			<p>It was a small and insignificant planet with cold temperatures and dreary weather, considered a desolate wasteland amidst the thriving Central Nexus of the Greater Plane. It was a planet haunted by forests of charred and ash-coated willows, by viscous smoky fog that came too early and stayed too late. Its residents were long gone, whether dead and buried beneath lifeless dusty fields or fled to distant worlds like Mercorra or Tekkeriat.</p>
			<p>It was here, in a grim sense of fittingness, by the burnt remnants of Mardek and Thedra's former home, that Mardek found a door.</p>
			<p>This door hid the end of three dozen years of frantic running, desperate fighting, and cowardly hiding. Every life ended or ruined because of this god-forsaken quest would, finally, serve its purpose.</p>
			<p>Mardek would enter the tavern and find Range. He had to be there - there was nowhere else for him to be. Irivex had sent a thousand men after both of them, and Thedra after Mardek, and this was the only place left to hide.</p>
			<p>There, the two would create the Realm. An ideal world, free of the violence and ruin that the Greater Plane contained. Finally, an end to all problems. It was simply a pity that Thedra couldn't - no, wouldn't see the light.</p>
			<p>There was nothing left to do. No loose ends to tie up, no final goodbyes to pronounce, nothing left to do but to approach the door.</p>
			<p>And so they prepared.</p>
			<p>To approach it and place a hand on the brass knocker, so intricately carved that it seemed fit for a king's chambers, not some ruined shack.</p>
			<p>To hit the knocker three times against the door. The crack of the brass reminded Mardek of the crack of bone - that crack Mardek knew all too well.</p>
			<p>To harness Thought, and disguise themself as an elf - the image of one of the Guilds' high-ranking members.</p>
			<p>To step into the bar, and take a look around, looking at the automations and counters.</p>
			<p>If they're surprised, they don't show it.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Thedra</h3>
			<p>Thedra's eyes flash with dozens of years worth of memories. She lifts a finger, and rests it on Calennius's chest.</p>
			<p><b>"You... you did this."</b></p>
			<p>Her rasp is... different this time. It's a much deeper, darker sound; more of a growl than a scratching one.</p>
			<p><b>"This,"</b> she says, throwing her hands about here in an all-encompassing gesture, as though she was referring to an entire world and its troubles, <b>"this is ALL YOUR FAULT! And for WHAT?! For an OUNCE OF POWER?! For CONTROL?! FOR A MOMENT IN THE SPOTLIGHT?! Did you SEE what you did to Mardek? THEY'RE GOING INSANE! DO OUR LIVES MEAN NOTHING TO YOU?!"</b></p>
			<p>The bar's power releases a beat of magic, making its presence evident once more.</p>
			<p>Thedra takes a deep, shaky breath. She twitches violently for several seconds, and eventually takes another breath, steadying herself.</p>
			<p>Thedra reaches to her face, and removes her mask. Upon doing this, her metallic arms retract into her back.</p>
			<p>The front of her head, where her face should be, is covered in scars. So mangled and torn that it isn't even recognizable as a human face.</p>
			<p>Despite this, a set of pearly white teeth are visible, amongst the sea of dark red gashes. This set of teeth opens, and begins to speak in Thedra's false voice - a higher, southern voice. In lieu of this voice's typical softness, there is a cold, sharp anger to it.</p>
			<p>"You're no better than that bastard Irivex. He, too, wanted to become all-powerful. He, too, wanted to beat death."</p>
			<p>As Thedra speaks these words, an eye opens behind her - opens as though the air itself was flesh, in which the eye was embedded. She seems not to notice it, continuing with her speech despite its presence.</p>
			<p>Perhaps she just doesn't care.</p>
			<p>The eye was green, and completely bloodshot. Red lines ran through it like rivers - tiny rivers, rivers of blood. It hovered several feet behind and above Thedra, looking directly at her.</p>
			<p>It failed to notice, however, the human, standing in the corner. The human with the robe with the Cult's symbol on it. The human with the robe and the gun. This human began to load this gun.</p>
			<p>She continues.</p>
			<p>"I came to this place because I wanted allies. I don't care about some... some mission to kill my - ...Mardek. Irivex won't lift a finger against the Cult - he's too goddamn scared for his own life - and I needed some capable people behind me if I was gonna try to take that organization down myself.</p>
			<p>'Course, I'd have to kill Irivex first."</p>
			<p>A door materializes behind her - if anyone remembered what Thedra's door looked like, they would recognize this one.</p>
			<p>There was no one left to remember her door.</p>
			<p>The door begins to open - slowly, even comically, as the lights begin to dim, just a little.</p>
			<p>She continues.</p>
			<p>"I'm not a huge fan of power, myself. As long as I can control my own life, I don't need to control anyone else's. Scum like Irivex and the Cult seem to have some idea in their minds that they have the <i>right</i> to control everyone else. I disagree."</p>
			<p>The door, halfway through its comically slow opening, slams itself open. Beyond the door is nothing but darkness. Xownfos' truesight barely manages to glimpse a shadow beyond the door - whatever this magic is, preventing sight, is a magic too strong to overcome.</p>
			<p>A hand shoots out from this door. It looks more akin to one of Thedra's artificial hands than a true hand. Where Thedra has plant and metal making up her arm, however, this arm has darkness and flesh.</p>
			<p>This arm - ten feet from elbow to hand - reaches out toward Thedra. She whirls around to face it, and Calennius - <i>I</i> finally step forward to act.</p>
			<p>A storm of magic erupts from me as I <i>change</i>, becoming taller and broader. My hair changes from black to a dull slate gray, shimmering with silver streaks in the arcane light.</p>
			<p>A Talemnian, Luthan recognizes from nearby.</p>
			<p>A <i>truly ancient</i> Talemnian.</p>
			<p>I reach into my cloak and pull out a compass - a small, rounded artifact studded with jewels. The stones shine a bright crimson and I invoke Temporality, feeling power surge through my body. Time stops and halts to a momentary standstill as I reach into the folds of my cloak, which proceeds to disappear, the entire robe vanishing in the course of moments.</p>
			<p>Beneath is another, simpler cloth shirt, and where my arms would be - <i>nothing</i>.</p>
			<p>Blackness seems to erupt from beneath the fabric, trails of pure antithesis - not darkness nor blight, that burst from it and wind up my arms. The power that emanates from the wound emanates wrongness - something that simply shouldn't - or in fact, doesn't at all exist.</p>
			<p>But the eyes of the bargoers are instead drawn to the sword in my hand, an elegant long katana held down and away from me. Although made of a glassy dark metal - perhaps obsidian, within the Blade's depths surges a veritable realm of power, a vast, perhaps limitless sea of nothingness like a gateway into the black beyond of space itself.</p>
			<p>Enderae seems ready to spring from his seat, recognizing the weapon and hissing in response. He knows me - he always has, though of course not by the name I use.</p>
			<p><i>Assassin.</i></p>
			<p>I invoke Temporality and move before he can even register what happens next. Within the span of a moment, the blade slashes through the air and the hand is gone - the very matter composing it suddenly vanished from all existence itself.</p>
			<p>Trails of nothingness slither from the Blade as I step towards Thedra, who's frozen, staring at it in awe.</p>
			<p>She finally seems to see me clearly and surprisingly nods, her ravaged eyes conveying a single emotion as she watches me.</p>
			<p>Hope.</p>
			<p>Meeting her gaze, I raise the Blade in preparation. Nearby, Low's visage bleeds black smoke as it changes, his face shifting and becoming a completely different one altogether. Mardek urgently rises and makes their way forwards as Thedra bows her head, their arms outstretched and grasping.</p>
			<p>The Blade arcs downwards, trailing whirling tendrils of antithetical power, and for the last few moments of her life, Thedra feels truly free once more.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Somewhere, far away from it all, Mardek floated.</p>
			<p>Everything was a blur around them - the sounds of the bar faint and distant, echoing in the far corners of their hearing. Even the voices had gone silent; they lay in a quiet, blissful, nothingness, where nobody could reach them.</p>
			<p>Mardek watched, unmoving, as faint flashes of color danced in the bar, blurred as if many meters away. Movement; as Thedra stood up and strode towards Calennius, pressing a finger to their chest in a hostile gesture.</p>
			<p>They sighed softly. Why did they need to fight? Why could they simply not embrace the void instead, lay themselves down to this peaceful sleep?</p>
			<p>Mardek's thoughts swam, drifting away gently upon soft black waves. They had almost forgotten it all; why they had come here, what they sought... and now, as it seemed, who they had been. They remembered something about seeking freedom, a haven of sorts. Such a foolish thought, when the void awaited them with open arms.</p>
			<p>In that distant blur of color, the image that was once Thedra spoke violently as, unbeknownst to her, an outstretched, inhuman hand erupted from a rift behind her and closed in. Drifting upon that sea, the sudden smell of charred flesh and molten steel came to mind - one that startled them briefly before being submerged. Mardek chuckled to themselves. Ever the warrior, Thedra. Always fighting and pursuing, struggling on, even when she couldn't even hope to win. Why couldn't she just see it too? Accept the march of fated oblivion that would take them all some day?</p>
			<p>Dimly, they remembered her last words to them.</p>
			<p><i>I still care about you.</i></p>
			<p>For a moment, the words pierced through the fog, cutting cleanly through it like a dagger ripping a paper veil. Mardek shifted in the darkness, taken by surprise, before those black waters rose once more, taking ahold of the stray thought and pulling it into the abyss.</p>
			<p>There was no hope of that, of course. They had lost it long ago, ruined the chance themselves. No. It was better to simply turn their back, sink into the void where they never had to face it again.</p>
			<p>Was it?</p>
			<p>In the distance, Calennius reached forwards and drew out <i>something</i>, a strangely clear shape compared to their blurred image. Even through the haze of it all, it seemed to cut through the shadows, a sword blacker than blackness, a shade deeper than anything they had ever seen before. Even to say it was dark would have been an understatement - it was beyond even that; simply the absence of light, of matter, of everything.</p>
			<p>Though the shadows clutched at him, pulling him back towards the inky sea behind, Mardek slowly stepped away, edging further and further forwards, transfixed by the sight of the blade.</p>
			<p>Calennius swung it through the air, leaving trails of blackness behind as it met the shape of the outstretched hand and cut cleanly through; the appendage vanishing upon contact as if it had never existed before. The darkness seemed to fade before them, giving way beneath every slash.</p>
			<p>In those depths, thin as a scroll but as deep as the very cosmos itself within, Mardek saw only tranquility - a peace surpassing even the embrace of the shadows. Sleep; an eternal, quiet sleep, beyond even death, beyond all the worries of the world. The bliss of pure, untarnished, nothingness.</p>
			<p>Mardek rose from their seat, the bar manifesting around them, and rose from their seat, stepping forwards. The sword beckoned - the comforting embrace of antithesis, a void beyond the void. Even as Calennius made their way towards Thedra, their gaze was fixed only on what they held, calling to them with whispers as soft as falling ash.</p>
			<p>Calennius raised the blade above them - and Mardek leaned forwards, reaching outwards desperately. They dashed forwards, their hands closing around empty air; as it swung through the air and arced downwards, faster and faster and faster and faster...</p>
			<p>It was then that Mardek saw, and the mirage finally broke.</p>

				<p>The foci are, in the most commonly used order: Harm, Self, Thought, Shadow, and Defiance. The most common half-Focus denominations are Direct Harm, Projectile Harm, Projection, Illusion, Filling, Erasing, Silencing, Invisibility, Ignorance, and Endurance.</p>
				<p>The rogue classifications are, in the most commonly used order: Assassin, Trickster, Skulker, Thief, and Bandit.</p>
				<p>Assassins are generally trained in Direct Harm and Projection, which typically refer to the use of Harm to inflict rapid death by a weapon that contacts the skin of both wielder and victim, and the use of Self to transfer oneself to another location - in effect, teleportation.</p>
				<p>Tricksters are typically practiced in Illusion and Filling: the use of Self to create a false image of oneself, or on rare occasions with great skill and effort another object or person; and the use of Thought to cast implications into a target's mind, for example causing one to feel an emotion or have a realization they will likely suppose is their own.</p>
				<p>Skulkers wield primarily Erasing and Silencing, to augment what is typically vastly trained natural stealth. Erasing is the counterpart of Filling: the use of Thought to obscure a target's mind, such as causing one not to feel an emotion, or repressing a thought the target would have had naturally. Silencing does not refer solely to the reduction of sound, but of all sensory input other than sight - sound, smell, and even touch and taste are subject to the dampening of a Skulker.</p>

			<h2>Epilogues:</h2>
			<h3>The Broken Ones</h3>
			<p>She was dead, and Mardek hadn't even lifted a single finger to try and stop it.</p>
			<p>They stand in silence, still clad in Low's Summer Armor - hours afterwards, they hadn't found the will to even take it off yet. The wind howls through a landscape of rugged cliffs and azure waters-the northernmost end of the Jossic Emerald Coast.</p>
			<p>Once more, their thoughts drift to <i>her</i> again.</p>
			<p>Another failure. Another unfixable mistake. They had crossed the point of no return, sent her to almost-certain demise. Their inaction had ruined their life once more; and this time, they had to deal with the consequences alone.</p>
			<p><i>Alone.</i></p>
			<p>Another rift opens in the air behind them, crackling as it expands, and Calennius steps out, landing softly on the ground nearby.</p>
			<p>"<i>You</i>," Mardek growls. "You killed her. You <i>killed</i> her, cultist."</p>
			<p>"Cultist?" Calennius asks in an almost amused tone. "Am I, now?</p>
			<p>Child, I was there long before the oldest of the Prophets, before the very Interpreter himself. I was there, with him, the man who I respected and still respect most, when he Ascended, with him as he opened the Well to seize the powers of creation, with him when he died by my own hand. I had a chance to become the Sovereign itself - and yet I turned it down all the same.</p>
			<p>What do you know of loss? I killed him, and then watched the one I loved most die from my inability to act. Thedra was a tortured being, <i>suffering</i> from what held her prisoner. To her, death was freedom."</p>
			<p>Mardek watches them warily. "What do you want?"</p>
			<p>"Foremost?" Calennius asks. "An apology.</p>
			<p>I am not blind to what I have done. I would not have if I had the option - but her death was a necessity. The power she held was too dangerous - it chained her, and she knew it too.</p>
			<p>And second? A gift."</p>
			<p>Mardek turns slowly and Calennius smiles in response.</p>
			<p>"Your suspicions earlier were correct. Demiplanes like that which you seek cannot be created with pure magical input, no matter how great. They require something more primordial... but refined to a fine precision.</p>
			<p>We needed a very specific set of powers; one that can finally be acquired now."</p>
			<p>They reach into their cloak and draw out an object-a sheath, encrusted with layers upon layers of dampening runes. Even so, the power beneath was unmistakable - it seemed to radiate a <i>wrongness</i> even through the container.</p>
			<p>The Blade. The very thing that had killed her.</p>
			<p>"Four is the key," Calennius spoke. "Creation and destruction. Space and decay. No less and no more. Each must be assigned a different holder-as a task of such magnitude requires the utmost carefulness. Your efforts have been crucial to the cause, and you are one of the most experienced - perhaps the only remaining one experienced enough - we can find.</p>
			<p>You want to act at last? Join us-and prove to us, prove to <i>her</i>, that you have been worth it all this time."</p>
			<p>Mardek closes their eyes. Once, they had believed; always dreamed of an answer to all the problems they had, always hoped for a life free from it all. They had gone so far to make that dream a reality; how could they abandon it now?</p>
			<p>But she, even if distant, had always been there.</p>
			<p>And she was now gone.</p>
			<p>"I know what you believe," Calennius says, their voice soft. "You hate me for it, do you? And you hate yourself even more.</p>
			<p>But you also know, deep in your heart, that she would have wanted this for you even so.</p>
			<p>Do not do this for any of us - I know you will never bring yourself to believe so. No, Mardek - do it for her."</p>
			<p>Mardek nods. They slowly step forwards and reach out, hands shaking. Calennius' eyes glow in approval as they put the sheath in their hands, then step back.</p>
			<p>"Forty days," they call out to him as another rift appears behind them. "Ranjj will notify you when the time comes.</p>
			<p>I trust you know where to go."</p>
			<p>Mardek was silent as the planeshifter steps back through the gateway, barely even giving them a glance.</p>
			<p>Perhaps what they spoke was true. Perhaps that was what Thedra would truly have wanted for them; to escape the nightmare they had been chained to for so long. Perhaps it was time for a new beginning, where they could finally be free from it all.</p>
			<p>And perhaps they <i>would</i> join them in the end. Perhaps they would forge the new Realm together, create a world distant from the violence and horror that consumed the Plane.</p>
			<p>Perhaps they would; and when it was all done and nothing else was left, they would return, triumphant at last, savior of it all, and kill Calennius; slay that bastard who had murdered Thedra and consigned them all to this wretched fate.</p>
			<p>And for the first time in decades, the voices sang together in perfect harmony.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>A voice breaks silent darkness.</p>
			<p>"There have been... concerns, recently, about the quality of your decision making skills, Sevrien."</p>
			<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
			<p>A different voice sounds in the shadows, speaking in an irritated tone.</p>
			<p>"Rumors of... particularly visible activity in Hernan," the first speaker responds. Their tone is soft and cynical.</p>
			<p>"The shrines? The heretics deserved it, always spouting off about their king. They should've just accepted the Triumv-"</p>
			<p>Low stabs five feet to his left and Sevrien collapses upon the floor, his illusion dispelled.</p>
			<p>"You idiot. You were given a chance, because you were effective. I'll be revising the requirements to apply for management ranks after this. Did you forget that I'm not religious? You should've known better than to tell me the peaceful priests deserved to be violently executed."</p>
			<p>His monologue finished, Low compelled Harm, and Sevrien died.</p>
			<span class="annotation">
				Funnily enough, Mardek and Sevrien are, or were, both classified as tricksters, even though they were in charge of large groups of assassins. Mardek, though, is experienced in each enigmatic Focus, making them likely the most powerful rogue in available history.

			<hr>
			<p>The water was refreshing. He'd been reading - for hours, apparently - and had forgotten to get anything to drink.</p>
			<p>Except... something felt a bit off. Compared to the relative, consistent peacefulness of the shrine, it almost felt like there was about to be a fight. He looked over. It seemed like Jaiv had felt it too.</p>
			<p>And then... a shadow. How long had they been there? The place was brightly lit, how had he missed the figure? He couldn't even see their face, they had black clothing... they should've stood out, not blended in!</p>
			<p>"I'm looking for someone," the figure speaks. "Their name, supposedly, is Cryst, and I've been advised to ask after them here. Do you know where they are?"</p>
			<p>Daze was very, very uncomfortable with this situation.</p>
			<p>"That's... not information we give out regularly, uh... sir?"</p>
			<p>This was a total lie. When someone asked after food or rest, referring them to Cryst was basically the default answer. It was absolutely the exact kind of information they gave out to people regularly.</p>
			<p>The figure sighs, their face still hidden.</p>
			<p>"I'm afraid I didn't bring my credentials with me. Would a signet work?"</p>
			<p>"Uh... yes, sir?"</p>
			<p>The figure pulls out a token with a symbol of a dagger and a shortsword, overlayed so that the dagger was completely within the shortsword's outline.</p>
			<p>The figure sighs. "Do you recognize this?"</p>
			<p>He did. The symbol of the Order of the Blade. The group that had massacred shrines across Hernan.</p>
			<p>"Y-yes, sir."</p>
			<p>"Then you know what I am capable of doing, and not just to you. I advise you to comply. Where is Cryst?"</p>
			<p>Daze was still too terrified to answer. Too scared to even think.</p>
			<p>"Need a moment to remember?"</p>
			<p>The panic shut off like a blown-out candle. It was just... gone. The fear was still very much there, however, like how blowing out a candle's fire didn't blow away the candlestick.</p>
			<p>"In... in her room, I think? Uh, that way and a right turn, go past the stairs. What did you do? What are you going to do?"</p>
			<p>The panic returned just as quickly. Had he really just told this professional assassin exactly where to find her?</p>
			<p>"I helped you think. And now, I'll help me think. Really, I don't see what's so terrifying about that."</p>
			<hr>
			<p>The door was locked. Was. Past tense. It'd been a bit of a tricky lock to pick, but they knew a few tricks from the Eyes.</p>
			<p>Finally. It'd been days of just walking.</p>
			<p>Except, no. There wasn't anyone inside the room labeled as Cryst's. It was completely dark - they could see the whole room almost perfectly, none of the furniture disturbed.</p>
			<p>That's when they were stabbed.</p>
			<p>It was a good stab, aimed for the right point, plenty of force but not relying on it. They were already losing severe amounts of blood, evident because the voices were going quieter as they were losing consciousness.</p>
			<p>"Nice stab."</p>
			<p>They didn't want to use up all their Enigma again - that had been problematic the last time they did so.</p>
			<p>"I'm not... here... to, kill..."</p>
			<p>Their consciousness slipped away.</p>
			<p>"You're finally up again, huh?"</p>
			<p>Mardek wasn't thinking straight yet, so they didn't answer.</p>
			<p>"We would've put a knife through your head and buried you, but you made Cryst curious."</p>
			<p>Mardek almost instinctively reached for the Blade, their hand closing around empty air near their belt. They looked down - their belt was completely bare. They'd at least been smart enough to let them keep their armor - the Summer Armor, borrowed from Low himself, had healing enchantments, strong but specific ones.</p>
			<p>"Interrogation, then. Alright. Can't complain, especially compared to dying. Would you happen to have greylet tea? Or any form of alcohol, now that I think about it."</p>
			<span class="annotation">
				Mardek's put countless holes and tears in that armor. I think I spent six hours sewing it up when they got back. They're not allowed to borrow it anymore.
			</span>
			<p>Greylet was a fairly popular soothing tea. It had a fairly weak taste, but was also fairly cheap. More importantly for him, it was a weak Enigma restorative - a secret the Order of the Shadows kept well. Alcohol was significantly less likely, and less important.</p>
			<p>"The tea, that'll take a few minutes. The poison, no. We don't have malicious substances here, however popular, assassin."</p>
			<hr>
			<p>The assassin. They'd let them keep their magic armor, under the terrible assumption that the enchantments were all benevolent. Those last words had been disturbing, however.</p>
			<span class="annotation">
				I mean, the Summer Armor does have an enchantment that lets the bearer combust at will, so she has a point. Especially because it doesn't grant any sort of fire resistance.
			</span>
			<p>If they hadn't been here to kill, what had they come for?</p>
			<p>"Tell me straight, you filth," Cryst speaks. "Why did you come here?"</p>
			<p>"Looking," the assassin mutters tiredly. "For Xalabraxis."</p>
			<p>The assassin had the gall to glare at her, after she'd bothered putting in the effort to keep them alive, even after the massacres. "Go on," she says. "But don't waste my time."</p>
			<p>"Your brother claims that he survives. The next question, naturally, is where."</p>
			<p>Of course. Another seeker of power, like all the rest that had come before. Well, she pitied them if they were to hope to stand against who they sought.</p>
			<p>"Why are you looking for the dragon?"</p>
			<p>"We were companions for seventy years, so you have better things to worry about than my motives."</p>
			<p>That was a bit suspicious. They seemed to think that they could still beat her in a fight, despite laying exhaustedly on a sickbed.</p>
			<span class="annotation">
				Knowing Mardek, they probably could.
			</span>
			<p>"Like what?" she asks.</p>
			<p>They shrugged. They were clearly too comfortable in this situation.</p>
			<p>"Whatever you were planning on doing this afternoon is probably more substantial."</p>
			<p>The sheer gall of the assassin was ridiculous. She sighs deeply.</p>
			<p>"You will leave immediately if I give you this information?"</p>
			<p>The assassin's expression brightens beneath their hood. "Now that you've asked, no reason to stay."</p>
			<p>She turned to face Sieve.</p>
			<p>"Prepare a map to the cave in the Gemlight Cliffs, and collect the assassin's equipment. Not the sword though, they can get whatever that... thing is themselves."</p>
			<p>She looked back at the assassin. Whoever they were and whatever they thought, they would need to be quite sincere with Xalabraxis. The dragon was more than capable of, ever since what had happened, of defending himself.</p>
			<p>The assassin looks her coldly in the eyes. "Thank you for your assistance. Congratulations on surviving a rare interaction with the Madman of Selbrakir."</p>
			<p>"You were the one - you ordered the killings?"</p>
			<p>"No. As a matter of fact, I'm the one who stopped them."</p>
			<span class="annotation">
				Because Mardek frequently borrows my identity, our titles have gotten mixed together quite badly. People sometimes call me the Madman of Selbrakir, even though I've never been there.
			</span>
			<hr>
			<p>Mardek looks up at the moon. They had finally arrived at last.</p>
			<p>They were practically on top of the mark on the map. There weren't any good landmarks to judge where the cave was, so they had to judge the distance from an outcropping of rock barely within eyesight. They set their rope to rappel down, and looked for the hole in the cliff face.</p>
			<p>Nope. No cave. Wait, over there, yes. They hadn't seen it at first - maybe it was lit up? No, that was too hopeful. Although, the voices were a bit quieter, now that they had a goal to hunt again.</p>
			<p>They climb over and unhook themselves. The cavern ahead sloped ever slightly upwards - and furthermore, radiated a soft warmth from further within. Mardek smiles. It seemed she had been telling the truth, after all.</p>
			<p>"Hello," a deep, familiar voice resounds as a shape stirs within the cavern. "I did not expect to see you again."</p>
			<p>The shape shifts, and a huge red dragon strides out, chest coated in coils of ice. Eyes of blazing orange regard Mardek as they smile, extending their arms and disregarding the ever-familiar presence behind the gaze.</p>
			<p>"Hello, Xalabraxis."</p>
			<br>
			<h3>The Alchemist</h3>
			<p>A god spoke in Irivex's mind.</p>
			<p>The commands wash through his thoughts, beating and surging with power. He shakes, his metal frame trembling, as they resound once and once again, filling his body with Entropy anew.</p>
			<p><i>Survive. Grow. Spread. Grow. Spread. Survive.</i></p>
			<p>His head pounds - not only just due to the fury of the god, but with agony - the last few side effects of the spell he had performed. Even filled with power, he nearly crumples under the sheer force of the incantation - that damnable bar's defenses had somehow reversed his own strength against him.</p>
			<p>Yet even now, the lich's thoughts are still not clear. His mind wells up with hatred as they drift back to the moment. Back to her.</p>
			<p>He had been betrayed.</p>
			<p>Betrayed by his own kin.</p>
			<p>Ignoring the commands, ignoring everything, Irivex flexes his hand slowly, testing the strength of the metal claw. It moves smoothly, powerfully, with both the strength of steel and the flexibility of true flesh. He's pleased by the form - as it was said, the Fleshsmith's craft truly did improve each time he was revived.</p>
			<p>It had only been a month since he had been resurrected. He had not yet fully recovered - form was something almost foreign after centuries spent with part of his mind trapped in Concept, only a tiny fragment of his god. It was necessary, of course - it was the only way he could still survive, but still far from painless all the same.</p>
			<p>But now, he had a form once again. He had control - only for everything to be taken away so quickly again.</p>
			<p>The god speaks once again, the power washing through his body and surging up his veins.</p>
			<p>It energizes him, fills him with newfound strength. In a way, it's almost akin to the beating of a true heart; but so wrong all the same.</p>
			<p>The lich slowly swivels his head to inspect the room. The room had formerly been a temple - a shrine to that Hernandese God-King, Thailaik. Its windows shattered and walls coated with ash and thick layers of ice, it now barely resembled a manmade structure at all.</p>
			<p>Only one piece of furniture is still intact - the chairs that once lined the aisles are strewn over and shattered, and the grand organ is split into three pieces, its edges charred.</p>
			<p>He makes his way towards the desk, his iron joints creaking as he moves. The table only held two things - a tattered map of the Sjkaldan and a tiny cage. He grips the latter in his hand, holding it up towards him.</p>
			<p>Inside the cage is a rat, a tiny brown mouse curled in a heap and shivering from the cold. With a hand, he feels the rat's heartbeat - fast but slowing in the frigid gusts.</p>
			<p>With an almost gentle touch, the lich takes the mouse in his palm, feeling at its coat of fur. It cowers away in response, trying to stray away from his hand.</p>
			<p>Irivex smiles, and pets the creature's fur once more. As the mouse, its nose twitching, feels at the metal, he clenches his fist into a sudden ball, forcefully crushing the rat in his grip.</p>
			<p>Entropy rushes through his grasp, crushing the mouse with waves of suffocating decay. As the creature's mind begins to warp, coming ever closer to death, he infuses it with a burst of power, vitalizing it despite its rapidly decaying form. The god screams in his mind as he pours more power into the dying animal - fighting against its very will.</p>
			<p>Pain streaks his mind as the Aspect within him tears at his mind, trying to force him to relinquish his hold and bring the mouse to a swift end.</p>
			<p>Irivex, laughing madly, crushes the mouse even further. He feels it struggle as it dies, feels the god lash at his mind with whips of searing flame. He infuses the mouse with another jolt of Entropy as it breathes its last breath - just enough that it wouldn't die immediately.</p>
			<p>Several moments later, Irivex finally opens his palm, dropping what's left of the mouse on the floor. His claws are stained a deep crimson.</p>
			<p>He breathes deeply in exultation, feeling the pain spread through his body. It was a truly refreshing feeling - to be able to defy the very gods themselves. A cry of rebellion against the world - a momentary respite from his failures.</p>
			<p>Aur enters the ruined church as he crushes the corpse beneath his boot.</p>
			<p>As usual, the lich's form is that of a man, tall and even handsome, with bright violet eyes and a sturdy frame. At first glance, they seem almost human - an almost perfect replica of one, like a statue carved to exquisite detail. Yet their gaze lacks life, their facade is almost too chiseled, and their body movements mechanical.</p>
			<p>Today, however, Aur's image was marred. A scar wound across his chest, the flesh within blackened and charred. Irivex turns his gaze on it - partially in surprise.</p>
			<p>Aur's eyes glitter as he steps around the corpse, which is now pooling blood. "The scar is of no concern. I have... greater news... to report."</p>
			<p>Aur pauses and Irivex eventually nods.</p>
			<p>"An eagle flew to me from Zakkor today," the lich continues.  The Beastmaster has quite the news to report. Our old friend has escaped us."</p>
			<p>Irivex turns and faces him.</p>
			<p>"How?" The word is pointed, a grinding and rumbling growl.</p>
			<p>"You know of the halflife's betrayal." Aur says, his tone soft as ever. "She is gone, beyond our grasp - and so is the one she sought."</p>
			<p>For the first time in so long, Irivex feels truly surprised. "She could not have," he hisses. "She must still be findable."</p>
			<p>Aur's face takes on a faint smile.</p>
			<p>"She is dead. By, I'd imagine, her very own hand."</p>
			<p>The room is deathly silent as Irivex searches his spiritual bonds of Vitality. He finds the halflife's link and probes at it with his mind. There is no connection.</p>
			<p>He has been tricked. <i>He has been tricked.</i></p>
			<p>Irivex lifts up his masked head and howls into the winds, a guttural, desperate cry of unfiltered rage that resounds through the air and into the sky above. He slams his metal fists into the ground, ripping through wooden boards and burying claws into the dirt beneath.</p>
			<p>Aur steps back as the lich rips the floorboards off their hinges, slamming it into the wall with a spray of wood splinters.</p>
			<p>Finally, he stops, his anger sated.</p>
			<p>"Issue orders to pursue the insurgent." he growls, pointing into the distance. "Search everywhere. Use your contacts with the Warden. Scour this world, if you must."</p>
			<p>"At once," Aur replies. "But if I may, Lord... "</p>
			<p>Irivex turns his gaze on the lich. Even despite his seemingly calm countenance, Aur flinches in response.</p>
			<p>"What is it?"</p>
			<p>"The one we seek," they reply. "If the halflife is gone, then who does the pursuit fall upon? You know, Lord, that I have much to settle with that one."</p>
			<p>Irivex hisses, gripping Aur and hoisting him into the air. His eyes meet Aur's gaze, and the other lich cowers back, violet eyes suddenly aglow with terror.</p>
			<p>He almost smiles at the sight. Fear was always a good sign.</p>
			<p>Irivex drops him.</p>
			<p>"You will do what I tell you to," Irivex commands. "Now let me be. There is still much to do."</p>
			<p>Aur nods and turns swiftly around without a word, making his way into the distance. Irivex watches as he disappears, snowflakes swirling in the air and falling upon his armor.</p>
			<p>Moments pass as he stands in silence, left alone in the freezing gusts.</p>
			<p>It was an impossibility, escaping beyond the very gods' own reach. The power saturated everything - it was simply inescapable - a primal force that could not be defied. The god agrees, once again surging through his body.</p>
			<p>No. She could not have known herself. Someone simply must have helped her.</p>
			<p>Irivex recounts his past as he ponders. It had been thousands - no, tens of thousands of years ago. He had still retained a mortal form then, and a young one for that.</p>
			<p>But for what he lacked in experience at the time, he had made up thrice-fold with ambition. Even now, he still remembered seeing the power surge inside the newly opened well - a truly beautiful sight even looked upon from such a distance. He had come so close to it that he saw his own reflection in the churning cosmic pool - transformed in the depths, a sweet promise of what was to come.</p>
			<p>Of course, they had soon discovered his true intentions. The pain had been almost unbearable, truly, but in the end, he had managed to take what belonged to him all the same.</p>
			<p>And yet, Irivex had always remembered the vow they had sworn on that day.</p>
			<p>He was so far away from it all now, but could they have truly found him? Had the damnable half-life given him away through her betrayal?</p>
			<p>For could that touch he sensed on that horrible blade have meant their return at last?</p>
			<p>Something was wrong, the lich knows for certain. Something was so, terribly, wrong.</p>
			<p>"Aur?" he asks, his frame tensing. "Where are you? Call off the pursuit! We must leave this world now!"</p>
			<p>"I am truly sorry."</p>
			<p>Irivex turns sharply around, stopping to face a thin, silver-haired human. They step towards him, their eyes flashing with a myriad of colors.</p>
			<p>"You." Irivex says, at a loss for words. "How... how did you get here?"</p>
			<p>"It does not matter. All that does, my friend, is what you will do next."</p>
			<p>Irivex breathes deeply, his body filling with power. The god inside him surges, filling him with strength and lashing at his form. It wants to crush the newcomer, to snap their spine and break their neck, to consume them whole and turn them to rubble.</p>
			<p>It was a hate almost unnatural even for the god. No - it was a hate formed of recognition.</p>
			<p>"You helped her, didn't you?!" Irivex growls. "I should have seen it. Ever scheming against me, running beneath my boots like ants."</p>
			<p>"I had a debt to be paid," they respond. "And she helped me in turn.</p>
			<p>I must admit, I admire your tenacity, hiding on this little backwater world, but rumors spread quickly when given enough incentive. You've kept up this farce, changing worlds and slowly spreading your little tendrils of influence long enough. Too long."</p>
			<p>Irivex growls in rage, backing away as he feels energy surge into his fingertips. The human seems to fall for the trick, stepping forwards - and in a desperate, crazed burst, he grips the human tightly with a stranglehold of power.</p>
			<p>"You were a fool to give that... sword... away," the lich says, squeezing intently. "You are weak. Scarred by your last fight."</p>
			<p>The god screams - a cry of both anger and exultation as his grasp tightens, crushing the newcomer with the force to crumple steel like paper.</p>
			<p>His voice is thick and pointed. "I will... end you... now."</p>
			<p>When Irivex finally lets go, the human fades to smoke, vanishing with a puff. Irivex looks around, surprised, as Calennius appears behind him, almost as if materialized from the air itself.</p>
			<p>They sigh softly and look the lich in the eyes, meeting his gaze.</p>
			<p>"It is time to let go, my friend. Our age has ended - and now a new one begins."</p>
			<p>Irivex fires a bolt of magic in their direction, which detonates immediately upon hitting the ground. The image of Calennius fades to smoke again, and the lich turns rapidly in a circle.</p>
			<p>Three more projections approach him, dropping down from the roof to face him.</p>
			<p>"This is pointless," they say, speaking in unison. "You must rest."</p>
			<p>Irivex searches his Spiritual ties again, calling forth his bodies frantically. Strangely, he feels nothing - it was if the ties had been severed - either that, or he was simply too far away. Panic rises in his mind - and he fires the blasts more frantically, carving through all three at once.</p>
			<p>As if noticing his plight, Calennius begins to approach him slowly, tens and hundreds of images appearing from the air to surround him. Although Irivex blasts them away with bolts, leaving drifting clouds of smoke in their wake, simply more appear in their place, an unceasing, unstoppable tide of projections.</p>
			<p>Howling in rage, Irivex retreats backwards, his steps almost unsteady. The figures close in around him as he steps away, an almost unearthly smile on their faces.</p>
			<p>"Where are you, planeshifter?" Irivex growls. "Fight me, craven."</p>
			<p>One of the foremost images tilts their head in reply.</p>
			<p>"Is that what you want? Then I invite you to try."</p>
			<p>In an instant, the images collapse back into the central figure, who steps forwards. They draw a small jewel-studded compass from their cloak, which they hold upon towards him.</p>
			<p>Irivex smiles, feeling his body course with godly power. Tensing, he incants another barrage of spells, the magic welling up within his palms and leaving traces in the very air. He lifts his claw and begins to cast, preparing to crush the flimsy human once and for all with the might of the god's strength.</p>
			<p>And then he feels nothing.</p>
			<p>Irivex cries out in surprise as the very cathedral fades away before his sight, the walls vanishing and becoming massive quartz pillars that rise into a distant, starless night sky. The ground; or rather, the illusion of it, turns to mist - which stretches into eternity - an endless sea of rippling fog.</p>
			<p>"I'd thought you'd see past the illusion sooner." Calennius says, pacing in a circle around him. "But I suppose nothing, old friend, that nothing is truly as it seems."</p>
			<p>Irivex struggles against the bonds of the invisible prison that holds him, drained of all power. He roars, a cry of vehement fury, as he strains to move.</p>
			<p>Calennius holds the compass up once again, which has begun to glow with a soft golden light.</p>
			<p>"If I were you, I wouldn't even try to break free - I imagine even I couldn't, myself. This place is a demiplane - my own, which you entered through the rift you quite unknowingly stepped through a few moments ago.</p>
			<p>You stand in an Aspect Well - a jail for a god. I'm quite sure you remember your own experience with them - long ago."</p>
			<p>Calennius looks him in the eyes, their expression almost pitiful as the compass' jewels fade to white.</p>
			<p>"I'm sure you already know that you can take power from them. But what's truly interesting is that some, with just the right conditions, can do the opposite as well."</p>
			<p>Before the lich can react, the human holds the compass towards his body. The god screams once more as it's pulled from the lich's form, assimilated into the device and captured within. As the power floods away from his body, Irivex screams uncontrollably, his voice torn to shreds by the bitter winds.</p>
			<p>Calennius does not react, eyes fixated on Irivex as they watch him struggle. They are cold - as pale and frigid as the very chill that now encroaches and swoops in for the kill.</p>
			<p>A single spoken word echoes from their lips - a word that brings back a torrent of memories, cascading forwards and drowning him within.</p>
			<p>Not just any word - a name, one that causes him to close his eyes as he thrashes to get away.</p>
			<p>"Ellara."</p>
			<p>And then, finally, after eons of prolonged life, Death finds him at last.</p>
			<h3>The King</h3>
			<p>Darius Vaexattor had won the game.</p>
			<p>Around him, cries and groans pierced the air as lines of noblemen, driven at spearpoint, were herded into cramped cells and locked inside. Darius counted the sigils as he makes his way forwards - Valagen, Rennain, Carador. The most powerful men in the Empire, now reduced to whimpering dogs in a single night.</p>
			<p>He passes by lines of guards in Vaexattor gold, smiling softly. They salute him, slamming their spears into the floor and bowing low.</p>
			<p>His gambit had truly paid off - with the capital in riots, the Sovereign's men had quickly managed to take the city. He had sealed off the Imperial palace with his men - and now, the Empress herself and her court were safely in his grasp.</p>
			<p>He reaches upwards and takes his crown off his head, feeling at the smooth band of ornately carved gold. It's marked with a ruby carved into the shape of a flame - the emblem of his House - and soon, his new dynasty.</p>
			<p>For Darius was King Vaexattor now.</p>
			<p>Finally, Darius stops at the far end of the hallway, where a figure sits gloomily in a solitary cell. It's pitch-black, shrouding the woman within a mantle of shadow.</p>
			<p>She looks up as Darius approaches, locking the door behind him. Still smiling, he sits down beside her, meeting her eyes.</p>
			<p>"Alexandra," he greets mockingly. "I see you've made yourself comfortable. Feeling accustomed to your new home?"</p>
			<p>The woman - the girl glares at him coldly, her palms clenched into fists. Seemingly barely seventeen, her expression is ghostly pale.</p>
			<p>"Damn you," she whispers. "I trusted you."</p>
			<p>Darius chuckles. "And you were warned against it - so many times. You should have listened to your advisors in the first place."</p>
			<p>"You were an honorable man," she says. "They all said you were. Your house had a legacy of it."</p>
			<p>Darius leers at her. "And who were they?" He notices her expression, eyes lighting up. "Who spread those tales in the first place?"</p>
			<p>Darius sits down, causing her to spit in his direction. He brushes it from his cloak, ignoring her.</p>
			<p>"Politics, Empress, is a game of lies. Spies are the most powerful piece on the board - they start wars, dethrone kings, change nations. And the most honorable of them are always the first to fail - it's your first warning that something is wrong."</p>
			<p>He turns to stand.</p>
			<p>"Here's a final word of advice before I leave you to enjoy the rest of your life. Trust, my friend, is the very first sign of imminent betrayal."</p>
			<p>Leaving the cell behind, Darius sets down the hallway. Striding down the passage, he stops at the farmost door and twists the knob, preparing to leave. Instead, the knob refuses to budge - to his surprise, it's seemingly locked from the outside.</p>
			<p>Darius pounds on the door furiously, slamming his fists against the oaken wood. "Guards?" he yells. "Open the door at once!"</p>
			<p>"There is no way out."</p>
			<p>As if made from the shadows themselves, a figure materializes from the darkness behind him, shrouded in blackness. Their clarity resolves as they approach - a thin man with silvery-black hair and a pale countenance. They wear a tattered uniform, covered in scratches and rips - and they hold a strange device in their hands - a cylindrical tube that they hold with a handle, pointed directly at him.</p>
			<p>"Who are you?" Darius asks, fear rising in his stomach. "This place is restricted to soldiers. Leave at once before I call my guards on you. Leave, did you hear me?"</p>
			<p>"Your men cannot help you now," he says gravely. "You have locked yourself in."</p>
			<p>Darius stumbles backwards, his pitch rising in panic. "You do not know who you threaten. Get out!"</p>
			<p>The man ignores him, circling him with the tube still drawn. "But I do know, Darius Vaexattor. Priest of the Sovereign." He nods, reaching into the folds of his uniform. As the man watches in horror, he pulls out a conical metal object, streaked with soft crystal indentations. It's marked with a familiar symbol - two concentric crimson circles crossed by a waving line.</p>
			<p>"No..." Darius stammers. "Y-you couldn't have... You were gone... Dead..."</p>
			<p>"What is my name? An interesting question. I have no name now, of course. I haven't for a long time."</p>
			<p>He lifts the device into the air, causing it to click softly. Once more, he raises it towards Darius' head, stepping closer and ever closer to him.</p>
			<p>"Once, though, that was different. My name, then, you ask?"</p>
			<p>His tone softens and he taps the hilt of the device again. Darius' eyes grow wide as something whizzes through the air at impossible speeds towards him.</p>
			<p>"Once, I was called Aurelion Darax."</p>
			<p>All fades to black.</p>

				<h3 class="exclude">Enigma and Enigmatic Foci</h3>
				<p><b>Page 3</b></p>
				<p>Personally, I consider thieves, who wield Invisibility and Ignorance, to be possibly the most powerful of the classifications. Invisibility refers to the use of Shadow to obscure one's view - whether it be hiding an object or person from sight or the casting of a "dark well". Ignorance, while initially sounding rather idiotic and dull, is typically defined as the use of Defiance to Defy a static object. Thieves are commonly known to bypass alarms and locks with impunity, as while they typically have such training, they can simply Ignore the door, or the wall next to it, or the locking mechanism as they open the locked door with ease.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile, Bandits are rather terrifying to behold - their use of Projectile Harm and Endurance allow them to perform best of all rogues in standard combat. Projectile Harm is similar to Direct Harm, except that a piece of ammunition is "charged" with Harm instead of a weapon acting as a direct conduit to a victim. Endurance is simply the Defiance of injury - while this certainly has its limits, there are - though scarce - records of Bandits ignoring strikes piercing their hearts to finish battles, though they perish soon after as their Enigma drains away at increasing rates.</p>

			<h3>The Man and the Machine</h3>
			<p>Luthan sat in an emptying bar.</p>
			<p>The torrent of motion merely an hour ago had slowed to a mere trickle now. Around him, the last few patrons were departing - Eoc, cloak wrapped tightly around himself, departed into a brightly lit hallway, and the two Enderians muttered amongst themselves as they opened a door to a distant city of towering obsidian spires.</p>
			<p>It had been only a few hours since he had arrived, and yet it still felt like an eternity. An eternity spent passive as the Cult tore open the Plane, the Warden watched from afar stubbornly, and more Aspects were unleashed upon the world.</p>
			<p>Aspects. To think that he had found two - or judging from Calennius, possibly even more, in his time here, when searching for forming wells had taken years without any result. Regret coils within him as he rolls the orb-like device the other planeshifter had given him along the table - he should have attempted to strike them down when he still could, even with the chance of failure.</p>
			<p>Yet, perhaps Calennius was not truly as malevolent as they seemed. They had seemed strangely sincere - and of course, they had granted him... it - whatever it was.</p>
			<p>Luthan holds it up towards himself, studying it intently. The orb, which is cool to the touch and strangely heavy despite its size, is composed of countless tiny metal scales, a web of miniscule steel plates that fit together in near-perfect formation.</p>
			<p>He did not doubt that Calennius' gifts were more than they seemed - and yet, what harm could come with this? He felt no effect on himself - nor any power stored within. If it was a trap, it was certainly a strange one to set.</p>
			<p>From nearby, Permafrost steps forwards, gazing at the orb inquisitively. He pauses and then slowly begins to hum - a low, droning sound, far more mechanical than natural.</p>
			<p>Luthan frowns. "What are you doing?"</p>
			<p>Permafrost stops, and gives the orb a confused look before clearing their throat.</p>
			<p>"I apologize. But this orb is evidently some sort of robot, and an active one at that. I thought it would respond to Machinan, but it's... unusual."</p>
			<p>A <i>robot</i>. Luthan pauses, and then chooses to ask what he sees as the obvious question.</p>
			<p>"How do you make those sounds?"</p>
			<p>Permafrost chooses to give what he sees as the obvious answer.</p>
			<p>"An implanted voicebox - what else would one use? A remote?"</p>
			<p>"Impressive," Luthan muses, still fixated on the orb. "How precisely does that procedure work?"</p>
			<p>"I don't bother myself too much with the details," Permafrost responds "They tend to break down in my homeworld. A surgery was involved, naturally.</p>
			<p>I would help you with your predicament - but after <i>that</i>, I think it's best to leave now. Here - I'll offer something of a more persistent nature you to consider."</p>
			<p>Permafrost pulls a pen and piece of paper, writes something down, and hands it to Luthan. He makes a whistling noise, and the mechanical spider from before crawls onto it from his sleeve.</p>

			<p>Permafrost looks directly at Luthan.</p>
			<p>"I'll be seeing you again."</p>
			<p>He turns, speaks to the bartender, and leaves through a door, revealing a glimpse of a highly decorated hall, lit mostly by brightly coloured fluorescent tubes.</p>
			<p>A machine.</p>
			<p>Luthan had suspected as much - and yet, what sort of robot could be so impactful in his search? Once more, what did the planeshifter truly want?</p>
			<p>He supposed there was only one way to find out.</p>
			<p>He closes his eyes resignedly and opens his mouth, pressing both palms to the surface of the device.</p>
			<p>"Hope."</p>
			<p>The orb begins to flicker, its surface glowing and dancing with beams of red light. Luthan almost drops it in surprise as it extends forth tendrils of twining metal, winding its way up his arm and covering it in a coat of steel scales. Within moments, the orb is embedded within an intricate gauntlet, each tiny plate aglow and rippling with energy.</p>
			<p>Luthan flexes his fingers and the gauntlet moves with him in turn, scales suddenly become as fluid as moving water as he balls his hand into a fist. The glove fits him perfectly, as if merely an extension of his very own hand.</p>
			<p>What had Calennius given him, truly?</p>
			<p>The gauntlet abruptly glows violet and the plates <i>hum</i>, a monotonous buzz that eventually crackles and clears into a crisp male voice with an echoing tone.</p>
			<p><code>"HELLO. YOU ARE NOT ELLARA, ARE YOU? NO - AND YOU ARE NOT MY LAST BEARER EITHER..."</code></p>
			<p>Luthan's expression is bemused. "And who or what are you?"</p>
			<p><code>"I AM NERO. DO YOU KNOW MY PRIME DIRECTIVE?"</code></p>
			<p>"And what may that be?"</p>
			<p><code>"THE REPAIRMENT OF THE UNIVERSE, OF COURSE."</code></p>
			<p>Perhaps Luthan had found something of use during his time here, after all.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>The Founder</h3>
			<p>Uz watched the world end.</p>
			<p>The night sky was aglow with light; comets, streaking down the sides of the heavens and crashing into the ground below. The normally dark landscape was lit by patches of flames, made radiant in the consuming glow of the raging inferno.</p>
			<p>Uz stares into the flames, unable to take his gaze away from the devastation. In the glow, he almost sees the silhouette of his own home - left behind long ago but still so vivid in his memories nonetheless.</p>
			<p>He blinks and the image disappears - yet still leaving an imprint in his mind. He tries to forget the troubling thoughts as he inspects his surroundings, searching for the one who brought him here.</p>
			<p>Where were they? And why had they called him here?</p>
			<p>The first of his questions is answered as the air crackles loudly nearby, splitting apart before his eyes with a soft hiss. Uz steps backwards as Calennius leaves the rift, setting the gun that they used as a planar key into their holster once again.</p>
			<p>"It is the first of many." Calennius begins, striding forwards to face him. "Truly the beginning of a new era, isn't it? Where the gods are free, left to run rampant in the Plane?"</p>
			<p>"Heat and Gravitation," he muses, his eyes fixated on the devastation below. In the distance, a grove was crushed beneath a volley of falling meteors, the trees turned to kindling in an instant. "A war between Aspects. To think that we unleashed this on the world. On all worlds."</p>
			<p>"The fools worshiping their Sovereign are close to a breakthrough," the other planeshifter states. "If they truly succeed..."</p>
			<p>Uz nods. "How do they still believe? How can they trust in a god that only brings destruction?"</p>
			<p>"Faith is a strange thing," Calennius states. "Perhaps they believe the Aspects will grant them salvation. Rest for the weary at last."</p>
			<p>Uz looks upon the landscape and finally turns to Calennius, the blazing flames reflected in their eyes.</p>
			<p>"Can you stop it? You bear both of them- could you not bring an end to this madness?"</p>
			<p>Calennius' expression is distant. "If only I could. Channel the power and fix everything. What a simple solution, hm?" Their eyes clear.</p>
			<p>"But it is impossible. What I hold is only a fraction of their true strength - you cannot channel a raging tide with a droplet of water. And even if I could, they would surely consume me after moments. What I bear is restrained - and even that still pays a heavy toll on my mind."</p>
			<p>"So you will let this go on?" Uz asks. His hands close around his planar key - a device in the shape of a small metal cube. They tighten as he stares at the chaos, watching as a row of trees toppled into the flames.</p>
			<p>"I'm afraid I do not have much of a choice."</p>
			<p>Uz bows his head. "This is the end, then? For all of us? We're left to die, haunted by our mistakes? It's truly unfixable?"</p>
			<p>Calennius' eyes glow a molten crimson.</p>
			<p>"For the Plane? Perhaps it is. But I have not come to you with only words of gloom."</p>
			<p>Uz almost laughs. "Do you truly have another solution?"</p>
			<p>The faintest wisp of a smile makes its way across the planeshifter's expression.</p>
			<p>"What if I told you there was?"</p>
			<p>"Then I would call you mad," he responds. "But I suppose we all are in the first place."</p>
			<p>Calennius chuckles and reaches into the folds of their cloak, drawing out an object wrapped in a thick layer of cloth.</p>
			<p>"This world may have fallen - but there are still countless more untouched. Those that have will be abandoned, yes - and I will weep endlessly for their sake. But those that still remain; perhaps there is still hope."</p>
			<p>"What do you intend to do?"</p>
			<p>Calennius unwraps the package, reaching inside. Uz watches him, intrigued, as they do so. "Three have borne this mantle. The lords of the End, who sealed one of their gods within to be worn by their king. An alchemist, who sought to be freed from death and sacrificed all he had to attain it. And me."</p>
			<p>They take out a crown of delicately molded gold, wrapped into a band of coiling strands and bearing a deep crimson gemstone atop it.</p>
			<p>Uz's eyes widen, incredulous. "You couldn't have killed... him, could you?"</p>
			<p>"I once believed you could never alter the Plane on such a scale as we hoped," Calennius continues. "I suppose we all did."</p>
			<p>The planeshifter runs their hands along the side of the crown.</p>
			<p>"The answer took me far too long to find. Irivex was difficult to pursue, yes, but that did not mean he was impossible to find. In the end, he inadvertently came to me - and now we have the last of the three."</p>
			<p>Uz's eyes widen. "You do not truly mean to..."</p>
			<p>"We may have given up on this world, but do we have to do the same elsewhere? If we sever the boundaries, stabilize the result and then immortalize it, what, I wonder, could we achieve? A place free of all this? Where we can begin anew?"</p>
			<p>Uz smiles almost unbelievingly. "And you have this Aspect of yours? I should have never doubted you in the first place."</p>
			<p>Calennius nods. "So, tell me now, how would you like to save the Plane? To forge a clean slate, a new world to govern...a Realm of Uz, if you will?</p>
			<p>Know that your dream is only a single step away."</p>

			<h3>Proprietor's Notes: A Backways Bar</h3>
			<p>And now you know the truth of this place.</p>
			<p>Truth is a thing with many facets - and this truth most of all. A truth that broke the world into pieces and forged one anew from the debris. A truth that killed a god and sent a people into ruin, a truth that ripped apart old friends and brought together older enemies, a truth that sent one to her death and another to a fate worse than even that. Truths that collided and clashed and intertwined, brought together by my hand within this very bar.</p>
			<p>Truths are dangerous. They are often far from the visions you want to see, reminders of the bitter reality in which we reside. But they, more importantly: are true, and can be learned from.</p>
			<p>We are far from perfect. We make more mistakes than any other form of life - and often to cataclysmic results. We are the harbingers of our own downfalls, the greatest force of calamity to ever wreak havoc in this world.</p>
			<p>And yet, I do not believe us to be doomed just yet.</p>
			<p>We study history to make sense of where we stand now. Dawn rises upon this newly built Realm, and I can only hope we can look back upon where we failed and hope to rise from it, anew and successful. There is always a next step, and with it, a brighter future.</p>
			<p>Old rivalries can be mended. New bonds can be forged. As we set foot in this Realm, we dedicate ourselves to a second beginning - a fresh start, where all can be forgotten in favor of something new - something better.</p>
			<p>I - <i>we</i> - have paid the price. Now let us not squander the chance that we have been granted.</p>

				<p>However, these classifications are hardly more than vague guidelines and generalizations - a Skulker can make great use of Projectile Harm, for instance, with proper need, preparation and practice.</p>
				<p>Neither are the Foci limited to the two halves into which they are typically split:</p>
				<p>Harm was supposedly once used for such a seeming irrelevancy as rusting an iron gate until it crumbled to dust.</p>
				<p>I have found a small collection of records of an ancient rogue who seemingly wielded Self to take possession of others, by placing a fragment of their Self into another's mind to compel them, challenge their will, and exploit their senses.</p>
				<p>I myself have used Thought to impose obscurations upon many, many secrets, and Thought has, on occasion, been used in tandem with Defiance to incredible effect.</p>
				<p>It seems that every few decades I come across a new report of a Skulker disappearing utterly in a flare of Shadow. Of that I shall say no more than this: if you watch a Skulker dissolve before your eyes, they are gone, and shall never be found unless they so choose.</p>
				<p>And once, I have witnessed a Bandit defy their wounds so powerfully that they closed before my eyes; Defiance has reportedly even been used as creatively as to refute counterspells.</p>
