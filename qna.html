        <h4>From the Realm of Uz Discord Server</h4>

        <div style="text-align:left; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">
          <p><b>How much will ranks cost? Is there pay-to-win?</b><br>Though ranks and similar purchaseable rewards have not yet been fully determined, we can confirm that there will be absolutely no pay-to-win mechanics implemented.</p>
          <p><b>When does this release?</b><br>The Realm of Uz will likely not be playable for quite a while. Though we cannot make any kind of timeline, we assure you progress is consistently being made behind the curtains. Keep an eye on announcements for news!</p>
          <p><b>What plans do you have to expand the development team and spread awareness of the project?</b><br>We do intend to use platforms such as the Crossroads and our new YouTube channel to continue to expand and promote the project. Of course, none of these are as important as your own role here. After all, you, the playerbase, are and will be our greatest source of aid, and we’ll continue to design the Realm of Uz to meet your needs in accordance with it.</p>
          <p><b>Will you plan on slowly powercreeping items as the server expands?</b><br>Each expansion of the Realm of Uz will come with a new pool of more powerful items, but fear not, as you’ll be able to upgrade every base item in the game to endgame level, allowing multitudes of unique and customizable playstyles.</p>
          <p><b>What will the death penalty be, if any?</b><br>We have a very interesting death system in design, made to be a core factor of combat challenges but which does not impact long-term progress on death, so it doesn't discourage you from continuing to play.</p>
          <p><b>At what level of completion will each part be released? Will it be longer waits with more content but less frequent or shorter waits with constant content?</b><br>Though we can’t speak for exactly what we’ll do based on the present circumstances, we do plan to try to balance out our large expansions with some small intermediary updates.</p>
